# siRNA Vehicles for High Endosomal Escapability

Hiroyuki Koide, Sei Yonezawa and Tomohiro Asa

## Abstract

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a novel therapeutic modality for the treatment of intractable diseases; however, the development of a useful siRNA delivery vector is imperative for clinical use. Since siRNA works in the cytoplasm, the ability of the carrier to escape destruction in the endosomes is a highly required characteristic for the induction of a high knockdown effect. Here, we describe the step-by-step procedure for the evaluation of high endosomal escapability. The vector that has pH-responsive characteristics at around pH = 6.2–6.5 is important for the high endosomal escape.

## 1 Introduction

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) specifically binds to its target mRNA in the cytoplasm after making a complex with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which cleaves the target mRNA in a sequence-dependent manner. Because of its high specificity, siRNA is expected to be an attractive medicine for the treatment of intractable diseases such as cancer and inflammation [[1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#CR1)]. However, since siRNA is easily degraded by RNase and hard to penetrate the cellular membrane because of its high molecular weight and negative charge, the delivery of siRNA into the cytoplasm without a vehicle is extremely difficult [[2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#CR2), [3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#CR3)]. Therefore, the development of a useful vector that allows high cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and siRNA release in the cytoplasm is required for proper siRNA delivery [[4](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#CR4)–[6](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#CR6)]. Recently, it was reported that only a few percent of siRNA molecules escape from the endosomes by use of conventional cationic lipids [[7](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#CR7)]. Thus, an increase in endosomal escapability is a critical necessity for siRNA delivery and induction of a high knockdown effect.

Here, we show how to design pH-responsive polycationic liposomes to overcome the endosomal escapability problem. We prepared polycation liposomes containing a dioleylphosphate-diethylenetriamine conjugate (DOP-DETA, Fig. [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)) [[8](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#CR8)], a pH-responsive polycationic lipid, were prepared and complexed with siRNA (lipoplex). We prepared two lipoplexes , a high liposome concentration lipoplex (cationic liposome:siRNA = 7000:1 as a molar ratio, High-lipoplex) and a low liposome concentration lipoplex (polycationic liposome:siRNA = 700:1 as a molar ratio, Low-lipoplex). The titration curve of each lipoplex was determined by 2-(*p*-toluidino)-6-napthalene sulfonic acid (TNS) assay (Fig. [2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)). The fluorescence intensity of TNS molecules reflects the ionization of delivery vehicles for siRNA. The TNS assay is an easy method to evaluate pH responsiveness of siRNA vehicles and obtain p*K*a values. To demonstrate whether pH-responsive lipoplex shows endosomal escapability, the localization of polycation liposomes, siRNA, and endosomes in cells was observed by confocal laser scan microscopy (Fig. [3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)). By using this method, we can clearly observe whether siRNA escape from the endosome or not, which allows the evaluation of endosomal escapability of siRNA vehicles.

TNS was mixed with polycationic liposome alone (without siRNA), Low-lipoplex or High-lipoplex in a series of buffers with pH ranging from 4.0 to 10.0. Changes in fluorescence values are shown. The apparent p*K*a value of each sample is the pH value at which TNS fluorescence is half of the maximum fluorescence. The calculated p*K*a values for polycationic liposome were 6.7 and 9.3

Scale bars indicate 50 μm

From these results and those reported by others [[9](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#CR9), [10](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#CR10)], we conclude that pH-responsiveness of siRNA vehicles is a critical factor for high endosomal escapability. We anticipate that the present procedures will provide helpful information for the development of useful siRNA delivery vehicles.

## 3 Methods

### 3.1 Preparation of Polycationic Liposomes and siRNA Complexes

1. Add 120 μL of 10 mM DOP-DETA , 120 μL of 10 mM DPPC, and 60 μL of 10 mM cholesterol in chloroform to a 50-mL flask using a microsyringe. For the preparation of fluorescence-labeled polycation liposomes, 30 μL of 1 mM DiD is added to the lipid mixture under shielding from light. Add 30 mL of *tert*-butyl alcohol to the flask and mix gently (*see* **Note** [**7**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).

2. Evaporate the chloroform with a rotary evaporator (*see* **Note** [**8**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)). Freeze the lipid solution by using liquid nitrogen. Dry the frozen lipid solution with a freeze dryer for complete drying.

3. Add 3 mL of RNase-free water to the dried lipid powder to prepare 3 mM (total lipid concentration) polycationic liposomes (*see* **Note** [**9**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)). Repeat cycles of heating at 60 °C and vortexing 3 times, each for a few minutes (*see* **Note** [**10**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).

4. With an extruder device, extrude the polycationic liposomes 10 times through a polycarbonate membrane filter having a pore size of 100 nm (*see* **Note** [**11**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).

5. Incubate sized polycationic liposomes and siRNA (liposome:siRNA molar ratio = 7000:1 or 700:1) for 30 min at 37 °C to prepare High-lipoplex and Low-lipoplex (*see* **Note** [**12**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)). For confocal imaging, use siRNA conjugated with a fluorescent molecule such as fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC) at the 3-prime end of the antisense strand.

6. Dilute the prepared liposomes to 0.15 mM with RNase-free water. Then, measure their particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and ζ-potential (*see* **Note** [**13**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).


### 3.2 Measurement of p*K*a of Liposome

1. Add 20 μL of 2 mM liposomes to 1.96 mL of pH-adjusted buffer (pH 4.0–10.0) and incubate the liposomes for 20 min at room temperature (final lipid concentration: 20 μM). 

2. After the incubation, add 20 μL of 0.6 mM TNS dissolved in DMSO to the mixture (final TNS concentration: 6 μM). Then, mix by vortexing.

3. Add 200 μL of the mixture to a 96-well black plate.

4. Measure the fluorescence intensity of the mixture (excitation at 322 nm and emission at 431 nm).

5. The maximum and minimum values of the fluorescence intensity are obtained, and the median value is defined as p*K*a.


### 3.3 Confocal Laser Scan Microscopy

1. Culture human fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080) in D-MEM/Ham’s F-12 medium in a CO2 incubator (*see* **Note** [**14**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).

2. Seed HT-1080 cells onto a 24-well black plate at 1 × 104 cells/well and culture overnight (*see* **Note** [**15**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).

3. Remove the medium and add 80 μL of fresh medium and 20 μL of the lipoplex (DiD-labeled polycationic liposome and FITC-labeled siRNA complex) at the siRNA concentration of 2.5 nM.

4. Nine hours after the start of transfection, remove the medium and wash the liposomes with PBS 3 times (*see* **Note** [**16**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).

5. Add 200 μL of medium without FBS.

6. Add 15 μL of LysoTracker and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C (*see* **Note** [**17**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).

7. Wash the cells thrice with PBS containing 30 U/mL heparin.

8. Add 200 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.

9. Wash the cells with PBS 3 times and block the cells with 3% BSA-0.1% saponin-PBS at 37 °C for 30 min.

10. Remove the medium and add 100 μL of DAPI, 3% BSA, 0.1% saponin/PBS and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C for the nuclear staining.

11. Wash the cells with PBS once and then add a few drops of PERMAFLUOR aqueous mounting medium.

12. Cover with a cover glass and stand for 1 h in a dark place (*see* **Note** [**18**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).

13. The location of the DiD-labeled polycation liposomes and FITC-labeled siRNA is observed by using confocal laser scanning microscopy (*see* **Notes** [**19**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10) and [**20**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10)).


## 4 Notes

1. Gentle vortexing should be performed before use, because the lipids will form deposits in the chloroform during the storage. If the lipid solution will be stored for a long time, we recommend that the lipid should be solubilized again, because the chloroform will gradually become volatilized during storage. 

2. Dispense the dissolved siRNA. Do not repeat freeze-thawing. Repeating the freeze-thawing will cause siRNA degradation.

3. To avoid siRNA degradation, all buffers should be prepared with RNase-free water.

4. Caution: FBS-containing medium is easily contaminated. So, pay attention to handling it. After its preparation, use the medium within a month.

5. Paraformaldehyde is a toxic reagent. Wear a mask, gloves, and protective eyewear when weighing the paraformaldehyde. Weighing inside a hood is highly recommended. To avoid exposing coworkers to the paraformaldehyde, cover the weighing boat. In addition, transfer the weighed paraformaldehyde to a cylinder inside the hood. As paraformaldehyde is dissolved in water with difficulty, stirring in a heated water bath (60 °C) is recommended. Use the paraformaldehyde solution within a week.

6. BSA-containing solution is easy to foam. Intense vortexing is not recommended, and gentle vortexing is better. BSA-containing solution is easily contaminated. Preparing it when needed is better. Do not repeat freeze-thawing the solution.

7. Do not add a large amount of *tert*-butyl alcohol and ensure that the flask is not too small to avoid breaking it, as the solvent volume will increase after freezing.

8. Evaporate the chloroform completely. After the evaporation, the remaining *tert*-butyl alcohol is removed by freeze-drying. *Tert*-butyl alcohol can be trapped in the refrigerated part. However, chloroform cannot be trapped. Evaporated chloroform will move to the pump, which may cause pump trouble.

9. After the preparation of the RNase-free water, dispense the water while avoiding contamination. Hydration water should be heated above the phase-transition temperature of lipids before use.

10. Positively charged lipids may strongly bind to the negatively charged glass flask. Short-term sonication may dissolve the problem.

11. Extrusion should be performed above the phase-transition temperature of lipids to form liposomes. Therefore, the extruder should be in a heated water bath during the extrusion process. Of course, the lipid solution should be heated above the phase transition temperature before being put into the extruder.

12. Do not heat above the melting temperature of siRNA (around 50 °C) to avoid dissociation.

13. Use of RNase-free water is recommended for the measurement of liposome size and PDI because cationic liposomes tend to aggregate in buffers.

14. Do not culture cells at the confluent state. Culturing cells at high density may decrease the cell growth ratio and liposomal uptake. The cells should be sub-confluent after passage.

15. Evenly dispersing the cells in the wells is important. The cell density in the well will change liposome uptake. Extremely high cell density may decrease liposomal uptake. To avoid this problem, using a microscope to check the cell density just after cell seeding is better.

16. During the washing step, do not dry the cells, as the cells will become detached from the well if the cells are dried.

17. Weakly acidic amine selectively accumulates in low-pH organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes. Since LysoTracker is a weakly acid fluorescent probe, it selectively accumulates in the acidic organelles. In addition, LysoTracker can penetrate the cellular membrane. Fluorescent signals in the cytoplasm will decrease once the cells are incubated in the medium without the probe after the staining. Since LysoTracker stains only some of the lysosomes, quantitative analysis is difficult.

18. Notice: Do not allow any bubble to be trapped when placing the cover glass on the glass slide.

19. If you do not observe the sample immediately, store it at 4 °C in the dark to avoid quenching.

20. If the intensity of the cell staining is not enough, increase the concentration of the cell staining solution or extend the incubation time.
