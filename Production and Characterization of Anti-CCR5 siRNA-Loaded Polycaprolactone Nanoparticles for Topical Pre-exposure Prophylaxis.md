Rafaela Ribeiro, Bruno Sarmento and José das Neves

## Abstract 摘要

Topical posttranscriptional silencing of host factors involved in HIV-1 sexual transmission, such as CCR5, presents the potential to prevent new cases of infection. However, issues concerning proper engineering of safe and effective delivery systems for anti-CCR5 siRNA may impair the ability to yield suitable silencing at the mucosal level. Here we describe the production protocol of anti-CCR5 siRNA-loaded polycaprolactone-based nanoparticles (≈100 nm). Furthermore, we present data regarding the physicochemical and in vitro biological characterization of obtained nanosystems, which support their potential as microbicide candidates for topical pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV-1 infection.

## 1 Introduction 前言

Global incidence of HIV persists at unacceptably high levels. Latest numbers from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS indicate that approximately 1.7 million new infections occurred during 2018 alone. Sexual transmission contributes for the majority of cases and women, in particular, lack suitable options for prevention that can be used without consent or even knowledge from male partners. Alongside other strategies, topical pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with vaginal or rectal microbicides offers the possibility to inhibit the onset of HIV-1 infection, while still at the mucosal level. Products undergoing latter stages of development are based on potent antiretroviral drugs such as the transcriptase inhibitors tenofovir and dapivirine. However, their performance in different clinical trials has been somewhat disappointing, with only mild protection being observed for some microbicides based on intravaginal gels or rings. Among other issues, rapid decline of drug levels at the vagina after product administration and/or discontinuous use have been pointed out as one of the main contributors for reduced efficacy. New strategies allowing for mid- to long-term protection without the need for coitus-dependent or continuous use of microbicide products could, therefore, be of particular interest for advancing topical PrEP.

<span style=color:blue>全球HIV感染率仍然居高不下，联合国艾滋病规划署的最新统计显示，2018年新增感染病例约为170万例。大多数感染通过性传播，而女性在没有男性伴侣知情或同意的情况下，几乎没有可行的预防手段。局部暴露前预防（PrEP）是一种有效策略，通过使用阴道或直肠微生物制剂，可以在病毒尚未突破粘膜屏障时抑制HIV-1的感染。现阶段研发的产品主要依赖强效的抗逆转录病毒药物，如逆转录酶抑制剂替诺福韦和达匹韦林。然而，多项临床试验显示，这些产品的保护效果有限，部分基于阴道凝胶或阴道环的微生物制剂仅提供了轻微的保护作用。研究表明，药物在阴道内浓度快速下降或产品使用不连续是导致效果不佳的主要原因之一。因此，能够提供中长期保护且无需依赖性交或频繁使用的新型微生物制剂，或将在推动局部PrEP技术发展中发挥重要作用。</span>

Small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of factors involved in early viral infection may constitute an interesting approach for prevention, as supported by multiple animal studies. The host C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) seems to be an excellent target for silencing. This cell membrane co-receptor is key for sexual transmission of HIV-1, as R5-tropic viruses are almost exclusively involved in primo-infections. Individuals presenting the natural homozygous *CCR5Δ32* mutation, which codes for a nonfunctional receptor, are highly resistant to infection. Despite recent controversy on whether *CCR5Δ32* homozygosity leads or not to shorter lifespan, people bearing the mutant receptor appear to be entirely healthy. Moreover, the objective of siRNA-based topical PrEP is to achieve transient depletion of CCR5 at the vaginal or rectal mucosa, which seems to limit the onset of any potential deleterious systemic consequences.

<span style=color:blue>利用小干扰RNA（siRNA）沉默病毒早期感染相关因子是一种颇具潜力的预防策略，多项动物研究已证明其可行性。C-C趋化因子受体5型（CCR5）是一个理想的靶点。这种细胞膜共受体在HIV-1性传播中至关重要，因为R5型病毒几乎是原发感染的唯一参与者。携带自然产生的纯合*CCR5Δ32*突变的个体，由于该突变导致受体失去功能，表现出对感染的高度抵抗性。尽管近期关于*CCR5Δ32*纯合性是否会缩短寿命存在争议，但携带突变型受体的个体通常健康无异常。此外，基于siRNA的局部暴露前预防（PrEP）的目标是在阴道或直肠粘膜暂时耗竭CCR5，从而有效避免可能出现的全身性不良后果。</span>

One of the main issues of siRNA-based microbicides relates to the engineering of suitable systems that allow effective and safe delivery. Although anti-CCR5 siRNA microbicides have been previously proposed for vaginal use, toxicity issues associated to cationic transfection agents used for delivery limited their further development. Also, more complex systems such as aptamer-siRNA chimeras intended for CCR5 silencing may not allow large-scale production that is compatible with achieving affordable vaginal microbicides. Kim et al. recently proposed solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) embedded in pH-responsive polyurethane membranes for the vaginal delivery of anti-CCR5 siRNA but no in vitro or in vivo data regarding silencing efficiency was presented. In this report, we provide a detailed protocol for the production of novel anti-CCR5 siRNA-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL)-based nanoparticles (siRNA@NPs). Their basic physicochemical and in vitro biological characterization are also presented. Nanosystems are easy to produce and were shown to present lower cytotoxicity than siRNA associated to a commercial transfection agent. When tested for CCR5 silencing, siRNA@NPs were able to reduce the levels of this co-receptor involved in HIV-1 infection. Although silencing was less effective than that for the commercial transfection agent, the enhanced safety of siRNA@NPs seems to assure that higher concentrations of siRNA can be used in the future. Overall, proposed siRNA@NPs may be an interesting candidate for the development of advanced topical PrEP.

<span style=color:blue>siRNA基微生物制剂的核心挑战在于设计能够实现高效且安全递送的系统。尽管抗CCR5 siRNA微生物制剂已被建议用于阴道应用，但由于递送所需的阳离子转染试剂存在毒性问题，限制了其进一步开发。与此同时，像适配体-siRNA嵌合体这样复杂的系统，尽管可用于CCR5的沉默，但其大规模生产难度较高，无法满足成本控制的需求，从而难以实现低成本的阴道微生物制剂生产。Kim等人最近提出了使用嵌入pH响应性聚氨酯膜中的固体脂质纳米粒（SLNs）递送抗CCR5 siRNA的方案，但尚未提供有关其沉默效率的体外或体内数据。在本研究中，我们详细介绍了一种生产新型抗CCR5 siRNA负载聚己内酯（PCL）基纳米粒（siRNA@NPs）的方法，并评估了其基本物理化学性质和体外生物学特性。结果表明，这种纳米系统易于生产，且其细胞毒性显著低于使用商业转染试剂的siRNA。功能测试显示，siRNA@NPs能够有效降低CCR5这一参与HIV-1感染的共受体的水平。尽管沉默效率不如商业转染试剂，但siRNA@NPs的安全性优势表明未来可以应用更高浓度的siRNA。总体来看，所提出的siRNA@NPs有望成为开发新一代局部暴露前预防（PrEP）的潜在候选技术。</span>

## 3 Methods

### 3.1 Production of Nanoparticles

NPs are produced by using a double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Genetic material is pre-complexed with spermidine by ionic interaction in the *Inner Aqueous Phase* in order to reduce water solubility and enhance association to NPs as previously described by Woodrow et al.. A schematic representation of the production protocol is presented in Fig. 1.

1. Add 100 μL of *Inner Aqueous Phase* to the *Organic Phase* using a micropipette and place the tube in an ice bath (*see* **Note** **9**). The W/O emulsion is prepared by using an ultrasonic processor—sonicate at 70% amplitude for 90 s (*see* **Note** **10**).
2. Transfer immediately the W/O emulsion into 5 mL of *Outer Aqueous Phase* pre-placed in a glass tube, placed in an ice bath. Prepare the W/O/W by sonication (70% amplitude for 60 s) using the same equipment (*see* **Note** **10**).
3. Dilute the W/O/W emulsion with an additional 10 mL of *Outer Aqueous Phase* pre-placed in a 25 mL beaker and under stirring at 300 rpm by action of a cylindrical magnetic bar. Keep the emulsion under stirring in a fume hood for 8–12 h in order to allow organic solvent evaporation and the formation of solid NPs. 
4. Transfer the suspension of NPs into an Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter and centrifuge (600 × *g* and 4 °C) until achieving a volume lower than 1.5 mL (*see* **Note** **11**). 
5. Add 10 mL of RNase-free water and resuspend NPs (*see* **Note** **12**). 
6. Centrifuge again (600 × *g* and 4 °C) until achieving a volume lower than 1.5 mL.
7. Repeat **steps 5** and **6**. 
8. Homogenize the concentrated suspension and collect it into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Make up to a volume of 2 mL using RNase-free water (*see* **Note** **13**). Store at 2–8 °C until further use.

### 3.2 Physicochemical Characterization of Nanoparticles

Plain NPs (i.e., without any siRNA) and different formulations of siRNA@NPs can be characterized for size, zeta potential, morphology, and amount of associated siRNA. A brief description on basic procedures to assess these last essential physicochemical and technological properties, as well as typical results, is presented in the following.

1. NPs are characterized for mean hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index (PdI), and zeta potential using a Zetasizer Nano ZS. Samples are diluted in 10 mM sodium chloride solution to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL and measurements are performed at 25 °C (*see* **Note** **14**). Typical results are presented in Table 1.
2. The morphology of NPs is assessed by transmission electron microscopy using a JEOL JEM 1400 transmission electron microscope. Ten microliters of NP samples diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/mL with RNase-free water are placed onto a 300-mesh nickel grid and stained with 1% uranyl acetate (*see* **Note** **15**). Images are acquired at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Typical images of plain NPs and siRNA@NPs are presented in Fig. 2.
3. The amount of siRNA associated to NPs is assessed by extraction and fluorescent spectroscopy. Samples of siRNA@NPs are freeze-dried and the obtained powder is dissolved in 1 mL of ethyl acetate (*see* **Note** **16**). The siRNA is then recovered by liquid-liquid extraction using 2 × 500 μL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl and 1 mM EDTA in RNase-free water) (*see* **Note** **17**). 
4. Quantification of siRNA in aqueous extracts is conducted using an in-house method based on the SYBR® Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain. Briefly, 20 μL of each sample are mixed with 180 μL of TE buffer containing the fluorescent stain (at final dilution of 1:100) in 96-well plates. After incubation for 10 min in the dark, and at room temperature, fluorescence is measured at excitation and emission wavelength values of 485 nm and 540 nm, respectively. The concentration of siRNA in samples is calculated by interpolation of a standard curve in the range of 0–30 nM, and samples resulting from the liquid-liquid extraction of plain NPs are used to dismiss possible background interference resulting from other components of formulations. 
5. The percentage of association efficiency (AE%) of siRNA to NPs is calculated by comparing actual and expected values for siRNA recovery, according to Eq. 1. Results for different types of NPs are presented in Table [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_22_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1).

|           | Spermidine (N:P molar ratio) | Hydrodynamic diameter (nm) | PdI           | Zeta potential (mV) | AE%        |
| :-------- | :--------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | :--------- |

### 3.3 Biological Properties of Nanoparticles

Assessment of the silencing efficiency of siRNA@NPs, as well as their cytotoxicity, can be achieved by using various in vitro cell-based methodologies. While reducing CCR5 expression is crucial for potentially allowing protection from HIV-1 sexual transmission, siRNA@NPs should also feature matched cell toxicity in order to avoid safety issues. In the following, we briefly describe two simple but useful protocols for the initial screening of the biological performance of siRNA@NPs. Toxicity to HOS CD4 + CCR5+ cells is assessed by the MTT metabolic activity assay. Silencing efficiency is based on the phenotypic screening of CCR5 expression by the same cell line using flow cytometry. Results for cytotoxicity and silencing efficiency assays are presented in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.

Data obtained for plain NPs is based on virtual concentrations of siRNA (i.e., matching the same amount of NPs as for siRNA@NPs—10 nM of siRNA correspond to 0.66 mg/mL in NPs). Results are expressed as percentage viability from non-treated cells and presented as mean ± SD (*n* = 5–7). Horizontal dashed lines at viability values of 100% (negative control) and 70% (frequently considered as the threshold for non-cytotoxicity) are included for guidance

#### 3.3.1 Cytotoxicity

1. Maintain HOS CD4 + CCR5+ cells in complete DMEM under routine cell culture conditions (*see* **Note** **18**).
2. Seed 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well on 96-well plates in complete DMEM and incubate during 24 h.
3. Replace culture medium by siRNA, siRNA/LPF, or siRNA@NPs dispersed at different siRNA concentrations in complete DMEM (*see* **Note** **19**). Incubate for an additional 24 h.
4. Remove culture medium, wash cells twice with sterile PBS, and incubate cells with 0.5 mg/mL MTT in complete DMEM for 4 h (*see* **Note** **20**).
5. Remove medium, dissolve formazan crystal with 200 μL of DMSO per well, measure the absorbance at 570 nm, and calculate cell viability as percentage of the negative control (*see* **Note** **21**). 

#### 3.3.2 Silencing Efficiency

2. Replace culture medium by siRNA/LPF or siRNA@NPs dispersed at different siRNA concentrations in complete DMEM. Incubate for 12 h. 
3. Remove culture medium and add fresh complete DMEM. Incubate for an additional 12 h or 84 h (*see* **Note** **22**). 
4. Collect and centrifuge (300 × *g*, 6 min, 4 °C) cells (*see* **Note** **23**). Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet with 100 μL of PBS. 
5. Add 5 μL of APC-labeled anti-CCR5 antibody solution (0.25 μg/mL in RNase-free water) and incubate for 45–60 min. 
6. Wash twice with PBS using centrifugation (300 × *g*, 6 min, 4 °C) to collect cells. Cells are then resuspended in 100 of PBS and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Accuri™ C6 Plus cytometer in order to calculate CCR5 expression values (*see* **Note** **24**). 

## 4 Notes

1. Avoiding user-originated RNase contamination is critical for preventing siRNA degradation, particularly due to the formation of aerosols as related with normal breathing (use appropriate mask). The use of gloves and gown is also mandatory. 
2. Handle ethyl acetate in the fume hood. As much as possible, avoid air exposure of the tube after adding ethyl acetate in order to avoid evaporation. Check frequently for parafilm rupture due to vapors generated inside the tube.
3. Check for any non-dissolved residues of PCL by thorough visual inspection. Repeated vortexing may be necessary. Alternative solvents may be used (e.g., dichloromethane). 
4. Use stock solutions of siRNA and spermidine in order to prepare the *Inner Aqueous Phase*. Prepare the solution in slight volume excess to guarantee quantitative transfer during the preparation of NPs. Use a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. The amounts of spermidine (42 nmol) and siRNA (0.3 nmol) correspond to a N:P ratio of 10:1—each molecule of spermidine contains 3 amine groups, while one molecule of siRNA contains 42 phosphate groups. Other N:P ratios may also be considered. 
5. Prepare a stock solution (e.g., 100 mL) and store it at 2–8 °C for no longer than 1 week. Poloxamer 407 does not readily dissolve in water—add the triblock copolymer to part of the RNase-free water and leave it overnight under static conditions at 2–8 °C. Bring the solution to room temperature and complete volume with RNase-free water. 
6. The HOS CD4 + CCR5+ cell line was originally derived from human osteosarcoma and genetically modified in order to express both CCR5 and CD4 . HOS CD4 + CCR5+ cells (cat# 3318) were donated by Dr. Nathaniel Landau at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, The Rockefeller University (New York, NY, USA), and obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH (Bethesda, MD, USA). More information can be obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program website. 
7. This allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody can be commercially obtained bearing alternative fluorescent probes (e.g., phycoerythrin). 
8. The 16 nM and 80 nM siRNA/LPF lipoplex solutions are used for obtaining final concentrations of 2 nM and 10 nM, respectively, when conducting MTT assays or silencing studies (25 μL or 250 μL of siRNA/LPF lipoplex solutions are mixed with complete DMEM to a final volume of 0.2 mL or 2 mL). 
9. Immerse the micropipette tip in the *Organic Phase* and transfer the content rapidly while avoiding the formation of air bubbles. The ice bath is used in order to minimize solvent evaporation and should be able to maintain the tube in a fixed position during sonication. 
10. The bottom tip of the probe should be placed at halfway the height of the liquid content and in the center of the tube when considering the cylinder section. The probe should be parallel to the wall of the tube. This setup should be optimized beforehand in order to minimize the time between phase mixture and sonication. 
11. The centrifugation time necessary to concentrate the suspension is typically 30–40 min. Start with a 15 min cycle and repeat for 5–10 min until obtaining the target volume.
12. Use a 200 μL micropipette and take up/expel the suspension repeatedly, until homogeneous.
13. Pre-assess the volume corresponding to 2 mL in the designated microcentrifuge tube by placing in it this volume of Rnase-free water (accurately measured using a micropipette). Mark the tube with a permanent marker, reject the water and dry it (e.g., under nitrogen flow). Estimate the volume necessary to complete the volume of the suspension to 2 mL. Use fractions of around 200 μL of Rnase-free water to wash the Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter and collect it into the Eppendorf tube until reaching 2 mL of suspension. Homogenize by brief vortexing. 
14. Filter the 10 mM sodium chloride solution through a 0.22 μm PVDF membrane syringe filter immediately before diluting NPs.
15. Uranyl acetate staining increases the contrast of NPs with the background. Although 1% uranyl acetate fits most samples, this concentration can be modified on a case-by-case basis in order to render optimized images.
16. Conduct dissolution of freeze-dried NPs as described for bulk PCL during the preparation of the *Organic Phase*.
17. Mix by vortexing for 1 min and then separate the organic and aqueous phases by centrifugation (11,750 × *g*, 5 min) and overnight incubation at 4 °C. Recover the aqueous phase (in the bottom—make sure to keep the temperature at 4 °C during recovery). The total extract volume is approximately 1 mL.
18. Cells are maintained in complete DMEM at 37 °C in a cell incubator set for 5% CO2 atmosphere and 65% relative humidity. Medium is changed every 2–3 days. Cells are dissociated when reaching 70–90% confluence using trypsin-EDTA (2–3 mL per 75 cm2 flask, followed by incubation for 10–15 min and inactivation with 2–3 volumes of complete DMEM) and transferred into new cell culture flasks at a subcultivation ratio of 1:3 to 1:6.
19. The cytotoxicity effects of complete DMEM (corresponding to 100% viability) and 2% (v/v) Triton™ X-100 in complete DMEM are also tested and used as negative and positive controls, respectively. 
20. Incubate at 37 °C in a cell incubator set for 5% CO2 atmosphere and 65% relative humidity.
21. Dissolve formazan crystals (formed upon cell metabolism of MTT) under orbital shaking at 100 rpm for 10 min, in the dark and at room temperature. Also, measure the absorbance at 630 nm and subtract to the matching values at 570 nm for each well in order to abbreviate nonspecific absorption interferences.
22. The total incubation time is 24 h or 96 h since the beginning of transfection.
23. Cells are dissociated with 400 μL of trypsin-EDTA per well, followed by incubation for 5 min and inactivation with 1 mL of complete DMEM. The full volume is then collected into microcentrifuge tubes. 
24. If needed, cells can be fixed with 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and analyzed up to at least one week. Cells are analyzed using the APC channel (633/488 nm). Results are processed using the BD FlowJo™ software (version 10.0.7). Suitable gating is performed in order to eliminate cell debris and doublets. Mean fluorescence units (MFU) are converted to relative CCR5 expression values by comparing with MFU data for native cells (i.e., treated only with complete DMEM and incubated for the same amount of time).
