# siRNA Therapeutics for Protein Misfolding Diseases of the Central Nervous System

Mark D. Zabel, Luke Mollnow and Heather Bender

## Abstract

Nanoparticles have been used to deliver siRNA to tissues and cells to silence specific genes in diverse organisms. Research and clinical application of nanoparticles like liposomes for drug delivery requires targeting them to specific anatomic regions or cell types, while avoiding off-target effects or clearance by the liver, kidney, or the immune system. Delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) presents additional challenges to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to specific cell types like neurons, astrocytes, or glia. Here, we describe the generation of three different liposomal siRNA delivery vehicles to the CNS using the thin film hydration method. Utilizing cationic or anionic liposomes protects the siRNA from serum nucleases and proteases en route. To deliver the siRNA specifically to the CNS, the liposomes are complexed to a peptide that acts as a neuronal address by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs). When injected intravenously or instilled intranasally, these liposome-siRNA-peptide complexes (LSPCs) or peptide addressed liposome-encapsulated therapeutic siRNA (PALETS) resist serum degradation, effectively cross the BBB, and deliver siRNA to AchR-expressing cells to suppress protein expression in the CNS.

## 1 Introduction

RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process that diverse organisms use to help regulate the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) available for translation. Dicer, an endogenous mammalian protein complex that mediates RNAi, cleaves double-stranded or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into functional, small interfering RNA (siRNA). The RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) guides siRNA to its complimentary mRNA target, which is then digested by Argonaute, an endonuclease present in the RISC. A concomitant reduction in protein expression ensues. Researchers have begun exploiting RNAi as a tool for silencing specific genes in biological systems. RNAi has shown potential efficacy in treating several diseases including hepatitis, cancer, ocular disorders, chronic pain, and neuropathologies induced by viruses and prions. Initial attempts to use RNAi in the central nervous system (CNS) primarily used intracranial injections of lentiviral vectors encoding shRNA. Lentivirus encoding shRNA against mRNA transcripts have demonstrated decreased expression of the cognate protein, but several aspects of this method limit its efficacy. Inadequate neuroinvasion by lentiviral vectors across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) necessitates their direct delivery to the CNS via stereotactic intracranial injection of shRNA lentivirus directly into the brain. Even then, lentiviral infection and shRNA expression was limited to a small area around the injection site, resulting in spatially limited knockdown of protein expression. This method also lacks desired temporal control of protein expression, since once brain cells are infected with lentivirus, it will likely irreversibly suppress protein expression in these cells. Moreover, despite improvements in lentiviral vector technology and construction, concerns over the oncogenic capacity of lentiviral delivery systems remain.

Nonviral strategies to deliver siRNA molecules to cells include using cationic peptides capable of crossing plasma membranes. Conjugating siRNA to these cell-penetrating peptides via thiol linkages allows for efficient dissociation of siRNA-peptide complexes by reduction of the disulfide bond in the cytoplasm. While this delivery method holds therapeutic promise, it still does not solve two important problems of drug delivery to the brain: cell specificity and transport of its cargo across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Kumar et al. developed a transvascular method to deliver siRNA across the BBB specifically to neuronal cells in the brain via intravenous (iv) injection. This method involves complexing siRNA to a short peptide derived from the rabies virus glycoprotein that binds specifically to acetylcholine receptors (AchRs) on neuronal cells. Adding nine d-Arginine residues to the carboxyl terminus of this peptide (RVG-9r) enabled it to electrostatically interact with siRNA and specifically deliver siRNA to neurons in mouse brains to suppress protein expression and protect against fatal viral encephalitis. This significant advance in siRNA delivery to the CNS was tempered by the lack of direct detection of siRNA in the brains of a majority of treated mice, suggesting that these naked complexes may have degraded significantly in the blood during transport. Efficient peptide-mediated delivery of siRNA to the brain after iv injection relies on protecting the complex from serum nuclease and protease degradation and immune activation en route. Alternatively or additionally, accessing more direct routes to the CNS may limit unwanted interception by these processes.

Liposomes are widely used as delivery vehicles for gene therapy products in in vitro assays. They are also being investigated for in vivo use in animal and human models as delivery vehicles for siRNA. Complexing or encapsulating siRNA with liposomes has been shown to protect siRNA from degradation and improve delivery through the vasculature. Cationic liposomes are most commonly used because they electrostatically interact with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of RNA. Cationic liposomes also readily interact with the anionic phosphate head groups of cell membranes. Liposomes will transfer siRNA into cells either through direct fusion to the plasma membrane or through endocytosis. Anionic liposomes are used less frequently because they cannot penetrate the plasma membrane and repel the negative charge of the siRNA backbone. But anionic liposomes are less immunogenic than cationic ones and can effectively package and deliver DNA by first condensing nucleic acid with cations that shield its negative charge. Peptides with affinity for cell-specific receptors covalently or electrostatically bound to liposomes can target liposome-siRNA complexes to specific cell types to avoid off-target effects. Adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) to lipids increases bioavailability and circulation time in blood by decreasing immune clearance. PEGylated liposomes increased delivery of doxorubicin and cisplatin in experimental tumor models and were used in clinical trials to treat a variety of cancers, including AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma and advanced malignant solid tumors, including those found in ovarian and breast cancer. Also, adding PEG groups reduces recognition by serum proteins and uptake of the liposomes by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system.

While protecting therapeutic agents from serum degradation represents a crucial step in transvascular delivery to target sites in the brain, liposomes alone do not provide cell specific delivery, nor do they ensure transport across the BBB. Coupling a monoclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to PEGylated liposomes successfully targeted them to astrocytes in cell culture, but still failed to deliver them across the BBB to astrocytes in mouse brains. An effective, efficient delivery system must do all three: (1) provide a molecular address to the agent for delivery to neuronal cells, (2) gain access to the brain by crossing the BBB, and (3) protect the agent from serum degradation en route.

Intranasal instillation of therapeutic drugs targeting the CNS offers a compelling alternative to transvascular delivery. Administering drugs or stem cells into the nasal cavity shortens the route across the BBB to the CNS, further bypassing immune cells more commonly encountered systemically during transit through the vasculature. Mesenchymal stem cells intranasally delivered have been used to treat mouse models of neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, perinatal and ischemic brain damage and brain tumors. Combining specific delivery to brain cells with a more direct route to the CNS further refines therapeutic targeting for these and other brain pathologies.

Using siRNA as a therapeutic agent and prion diseases as models, we developed three therapeutic delivery systems via two delivery routes that address the primary issues with current neuropathology treatments. Liposome-siRNA-peptide complexes (LSPCs) are composed of cationic liposomes with siRNA and a targeting peptide (RVG-9r) electrostatically coating the outer surface of the liposome (Fig. 1). RVG-9r is a small modified peptide from the rabies virus glycoprotein that targets nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the CNS to reduce siRNA off-target effects. Peptide addressed liposome encapsulated therapeutic siRNA (PALETS) are composed of either cationic or anionic liposomes with siRNA encapsulated inside the liposome, and RVG-9r either electrostatically or covalently bonded to lipid PEG groups. However, depending on the researcher’s preferences, the siRNA can also be electrostatically bound on the outside of the liposome.

**Fig. 1** Schematic representation of (**a**) LSPCs and (**b**) PALETS

For anionic PALETS , we use the cation protamine sulfate to neutralize the negative charge of and condense the siRNA to facilitate encapsulation within anionic liposomes. We also compared intravenous injection vs. intranasal instillation for delivery efficiency, therapeutic efficacy, and immune stimulation. LSPCs and PALETS decrease surface PrPC up to 70% in neuronal cells, and PALETS result in a decrease of the total number of PrPC expressing cells. Intranasal instillation doubled the response rate (60 vs. 33%) and halved the seroconversion rate (40 vs. 78%) compared to IV injection.

### 3.4 Injecting LSPCs or PALETS

1. Warm mice in their cage by placing it four to six inches below a heat lamp for 5–10 min (*see* **Note** **14**).

2. While warming the mice, turn on the anesthesia machine such that oxygen flows at a rate of 3–4 L/min. Turn on the isoflurane at 3 L/min.

3. Place mice in anesthesia chamber until mice lose consciousness.

4. When the tail vasculature is clearly visible, place a single mouse in the anesthesia chamber until its respiration visibly slows to 1–2 breaths per second (*see* **Note** **15**).

FVB mice were intravenously injected with liposomes alone (panels **a–e**) or LSPCs containing DyLight 488-labeled peptides and Alexa 488-labeled siRNAs as follows: PrP siRNA-control RVM-9r (**f–j**), Control siRNA -RVG-9r (K-O), or PrP siRNA-RVG-9r (**p–t**). Mice were sacrificed 24 h later, dissected, and their brains snap frozen and 8 μm sections thereof stained with DyLight 649-labeled anti-PrP antibody (**a**, **f**, **k,** and **p**) and DAPI (**c**, **h**, **m**, and **r**) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

Quantitative analysis of LSPC delivery can be performed on brain and kidney cells isolated from injected mice by flow cytometry and digital droplet PCR.

1. Sacrifice mice and remove their brains and kidneys.

2. Strain the organs through a 45 μm nylon mesh to produce a single cell suspension for flow cytometry.

![485053_1_En_20_Fig3_HTML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zcgkiller/Pictures/main/Wechat/485053_1_En_20_Fig3_HTML.png)

**Fig. 3** LSPCs target the majority of neuronal cells and deliver PrPC siRNA to the brain when injected intravenously. (**a**) Flow cytometry of primary neuronal cells labeled with BAR-224, an anti-PrPC antibody, and RVG-9r reveals that 98% of cells in the brain display PrPC and nAchRs on their surfaces. Ninety-six percent of those cells express both PrPC and nAchRs. A smaller proportion of kidney cells (78%) express both PrPC and nAchRs. (**b**) In vivo live imaging revealed that RVG-9r increased LSPC delivery to the brain 2 min to 10 days after intravascular injection compared to siRNA and peptide complexes without liposomes (SPCs). We controlled for background fluorescence using PBS-injected mice. (**c**) Flow cytometry analysis 24 h after fluorescent LSPC injection revealed siRNA delivery to 47% of brain cells and 15% of kidney cells (black histograms) compared to PBS-injected controls (gray histograms). Data are representative of at least seven independent experiments

3. Analyze protein expression by Flow Cytometry according to protocols specific for the PCR machine used (*see* **Note** **21**).


## 4 Notes

1. We have used siRNA prepared for us by several biotechnology companies, but have observed optimal knockdown using siRNA prepared from Qiagen. Additionally, Qiagen can label siRNA with Alexa fluorochromes to monitor LSPC trafficking for determining delivery kinetics (*see* **Note** **15**).

2. We typically treat cages of five mice at a time and therefore aliquot 1 mL of 200 μM stock siRNA, enough to treat five mice. Aliquots should be adjusted to meet researchers’ experimental requirements.

3. White mice (FVB, C3H, CD-1, for example) tend to be much easier to inject intravenously in the tail than brown or black mice (129sv, C57/Bl6).

4. The machine should have an incubating chamber and a nose cone. We recommend isoflurane, but alternative anesthesia, such as ketamine, can be used. While tail vein injections can be done using physical restraint, we strongly recommend using chemical restraint to avoid sudden movements from the mouse that can compromise the injection and waste valuable time and reagents.

5. Desiccation time may vary. Most importantly, the lipids must be completely dry. For faster desiccation, the solution can be split into several tubes.

6. Rehydration medium depends on lipid composition and experimental requirements. Lipid mixtures with anionic lipids, such as DSPE-PEG, have improved rehydration with the addition of a salt buffer, such as PBS. If injecting either LSPCs or PALETS in vivo, a biologically safe hydration solution needs to be chosen.

7. It may be possible to use different cationic and anionic lipids in these formulations depending on researchers’ requirements. If other lipids are used, other than what is listed above, rehydration should always be performed above the gel-liquid phase transition (Tm) temperature to ensure proper mixing of lipids.

8. At increasing molar concentrations, DSPE lipid molecules become more attracted to itself than to other types of lipids. The result is insoluble DSPE complexes that cannot be rehydrated or formed into liposomes. Therefore, DSPE should never be used above a 55% molar ratio.

9. Do not sonicate more than 100 μL per tube using this sonicator. Other sonicators may be used, but volumes may have to be increased significantly if a probe sonicator is used. Horn sonicators produce the best, most consistent results with the small volumes used here.

10. If used later, sonicate liposomes again prior to complexation.

11. LSPCs are ready to use in 10 min, but are stable for several hours at room temperature.

12. The covalent linkage of the peptide to the PEG groups is optional. If using DOTAP PALETS, the positive charge of RVG-9r may be able to bind to the negatively charged COO− groups of the PEG lipids. If using DSPE PALETS, the positively charged RVG-9r can bind to the negatively charged DSPE lipids.

13. This protocol uses protamine sulfate to condense the siRNA so that it can be encapsulated within DSPE PALETS. However, other small positively charged cations can also be used, such as Ca2+, depending on the application.

14. This step is crucial for successful tail vein injections, especially in dark-colored mice. The cage should reach an ambient temperature between 32 and 35 °C. The lateral tail veins and/or the ventral artery should be clearly visible before proceeding. This usually coincides with salivation, so look for moisture around the mouth and nose. Monitor mice under the heat lamp every 2 min for signs of distress or hyperthermia. Do not leave a mouse cage under the heat lamp for more than fifteen consecutive minutes.

15. This should take 1–3 min. Isoflurane is very safe and accidental overdoses are very rare. Distressed mice can be given pure oxygen to help revive them if necessary.

16. If bubbles appear, hold the syringe vertically with the needle pointing up and flick the syringe until the bubbles dislodge and float to the top of the syringe, toward the needle. Carefully keeping the needle tip above the syringe barrel, place it on the inside of the tube containing the LSPCs or PALETS and gently push the syringe plunger until the bubbles are evacuated (i.e., when a small amount of liquid emerges from the needle). Load additional LSPC/PALETS mixture into the syringe to 250 μL if necessary.

17. Mice can be placed in physical restraints at this time if desired, but we recommend simultaneous chemical restraint.

18. Curling the tail over a finger can help orient the tail in a position that facilitates inserting the needle at the shallow 10–15° angle required for entering the vein. You should, but not always, feel the needle entering the vein lumen. You should feel little or no resistance on the plunger if you are in the lumen, and you will often see the vein blanche as the solution displaces the blood. If you feel resistance or see the tail swell just anterior to the injection site, stop immediately. You are most likely not in the vein. Apply direct pressure to the injection site for a few seconds, then attempt the injection again further anterior to the previous site. If this fails after multiple attempts, or if the vasculature is no longer visible, stop. Allow the mouse to recover, proceed to the next mouse, and try injecting the former mouse after attempting the others.

19. Hyaluronidase administration prior to instilling LSPCs or PALETS into the nose is highly recommended to transiently break down connective tissue matrices to facilitate efficient delivery to the brain via the olfactory bulb. Blocking the oropharynx during intranasal instillation helps build pressure in the nasal cavity that facilitates delivery by providing moderate pressure to force cells across the cribriform plate.

20. We observed LSPC delivery in as little as 2 min using this technique (Fig. [3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_20_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)) and detected LSPCs up to 10 days after injection. We observed similar pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics using PALETS and intranasal instillation.

21. Flow cytometric analysis of brain cells reveals that DOTAP LSPCs and DSPE PALETS decrease cell surface PrPC levels compared to untreated controls (Fig. 4a), and DOTAP PALETS decrease the number of PrPC-positive cells. Protein analysis in the kidneys shows that DOTAP LSPCs decrease both PrPC expression and PrPC + cells and DSPE PALETS reduce the amount of cell surface PrPC (Fig. 4b). DOTAP PALETS had no apparent effect on either parameter (Fig. 4b). Longitudinal mRNA and protein expression analyses revealed that mice treated with LSPCs (Fig. 5a, b) expressed less PrPC in their brains and kidneys over 21 days than mice treated with PALETS (Fig. 5c, d).

**Fig. 4** Analysis of PrPC protein levels in the brain after LSPCs or PALETS treatment. FVB mice were intravenously injected with either 1× PBS (untreated control, black squares), DOTAP LSPCs (green circles), DOTAP PALETS (red circles), or DSPE PALETS (blue triangles). Mice were sacrificed 4 days after treatment and their brains and kidneys were harvested. Asterisks to the right of symbols indicate statistically significant differences in percentage of PrP^C^ + cells. Asterisks on top of symbols indicate statistically significant differences in PrP^C^ expression. Asterisks in the center indicate statistical significance for both parameters. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean. Some error bars do not extend past symbols. \**p* < 0.05, \*\**p* < 0.01. (**a**) DOTAP LSPCs and DSPE PALETS decrease the amount of cell surface PrP^C^ in the brain, while DOTAP PALETs decrease the number of PrP^C^-positive cells in the brain. (**b**) DOTAP LSPCs decrease both PRP^C^ expression and the number of PrP^C^ + cells in the kidney. DSPE PALETS decreased the amount of cell surface PrP^C^, while DOTAP PALETS did not affect either parameter

**Fig. 5** Longitudinal analysis of PrPC mRNA and protein levels in the brain after LSPCs or PALETS treatment. LSPCs significantly repressed PrPC mRNA (**a**) and protein (**b**) expression more and longer than PALETS (**c** and **d**) in both brain (squares) and kidneys (circles). Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the mean. \**p* < 0.01, \*\**p* < 0.01, \*\*\**p* < 0.001
