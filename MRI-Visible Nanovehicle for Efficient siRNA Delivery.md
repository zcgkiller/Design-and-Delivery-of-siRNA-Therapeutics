Rongrong Jin, Wencheng Zhu, Gan Lin, Gang Liu and Hua Ai

## Abstract

Visualizing siRNA delivery through medical imaging methods has drawn much attentions in recent gene therapy studies. Among them, iron oxide-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is regarded as one of the most promising imaging modalities for its high spatial resolution as well as deep penetration and real-time properties. In this chapter, a detailed protocol of an amphiphilic superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanovehicle-based siRNA delivery is described, mainly focusing on SPIO/siRNA complexes formation and characterization, in vitro and in vivo siRNA delivery, MRI study of the delivery and transfection efficiency evaluation.

## 1 Introduction

Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) are short molecules of 19–25 nucleotides that can trigger specific gene silencing by unwinding the siRNA duplex when binding to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), thus mediate the cleavage and destruction of a target messenger RNA (mRNA) [[1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR1), [2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR2)]. It is well established that siRNAs are one of the most important biopharmaceuticals but showing slow progression [[3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR3)]. To date, two siRNA-based therapeutics have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): those are Patisiran and Givosiran (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals) for treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis and acute hepatic porphyria, respectively; 33 other siRNA-based therapeutics ([http://www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)) have entered clinical trials for treatment of several other refractory diseases including tumors, virus infection, ocular lesions, pachyonychia congenita, hypercholesterolemia, liver fibrosis, hypertrophic scar, delayed graft function, hyperoxaluria, etc. Of note, most of siRNA therapeutics require highly efficient delivery systems which is nowadays the biggest obstacle for developing siRNA therapeutics as a powerful new treatment paradigm [[4](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR4), [5](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR5)]. In recent years, carefully designed nanoparticles are developed for siRNA delivery instead of traditionally high-risk viral vectors [[6](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR6), [7](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR7)]. However, there are still several challenges presented to siRNA delivery in vivo such as satisfied blood half-life, favorable pathologic tissue target, efficient transfer across the cell membrane, and adequate tissue bioavailability, as well as stability of siRNA [[8](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR8)]. The improvement of these requirements would be greatly accelerated by noninvasive and real-time evaluation methods such as medical imaging tools [[9](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR9)]. Iron oxide nanoparticles based MRI has several advantages over other imaging modalities, including deep tissue penetration, high spatial and temporal resolution, excellent soft tissue contrast, as well as non-radiative compared with *CT* and *SPECT*/*PET* scanning [[10](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR10), [11](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR11)]. In our previous studies, low molecular-weight (2 kDa) amphiphilic alkylated polyethylenimine (Alkyl-PEI) wrapped SPIO nanoparticles (Alkyl-PEI/SPIO) were fabricated, showing improved *T**2* relaxivity and good bio-safety [[12](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR12), [13](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR13)]. Their siRNA delivery efficiency toward breast cancer cells were also examined both in vitro and in vivo [[14](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR14), [15](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#CR15)], suggesting a promising nanovehicle for simultaneous noninvasive imaging and delivery of siRNAs.

This chapter will provide a detailed protocol for Alkyl-PEI/SPIO-siRNA complexes formation and characterization, transfection of siRNA by the complexes, evaluation of cellular uptake as well as transfection efficiency and detection of the labeled cells under a clinical MRI scanner.

### 3.2 Alkyl-PEI/SPIO-siRNA Complex Formation and Characterization (see Note [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#Sec22))

1. Gently added the required amount of siRNA solution to Alkyl-PEI/SPIO dispersions in RNAase-free solution with different N/P ratios (i.e., N/P ratios are set as 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40) (*see* **Note** [**2**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#Sec22)).
2. Incubate the prepared mixture at room temperature for 15–20 min to allow for the condensation of siRNA by amines on Alkyl-PEI/SPIO.
3. Characterize the particle size and zeta potential of nano complexes by dynamic light scattering (DLS); observe particle morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
4. Use Gel retardation assay to evaluate the siRNA compaction efficacy in complexes at different N/P ratios. Load All samples containing 200 ng siRNA onto 2% agarose gel (w/v) with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide in tris-acetate running buffer for electrophoresis (100 V, 15 min). Image siRNA bands by the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS+. Express binding capacity by the threshold N/P ratio, above which siRNA are completely retarded in the pores and below which unbound siRNA migrated quickly through the gel matrix (Fig. [1a](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)).
5. Use heparin decomplexation assay to mimic the siRNA release behavior under biological environment in vitro. Mix Alkyl-PEI/SPIO and siRNA (200 ng) at totally condensation N/P ratio (20:1) and incubate them at room temperature for 15 min. Then add varied amounts of heparin (heparin/siRNA weight ratio: 0, 100, 25, 10, 2) for another 15 min incubation at room temperature. Thereafter subject the mixtures to the gel electrophoresis analysis as described above. Reflect the release efficacy as well as binding capacity by the amount of added heparin (Fig. [1b](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)).
6. For evaluation of the stability of complexes in serum, firstly mix Alkyl-PEI/SPIO and siRNA (200 ng) at ratio of N/P = 20 followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min as described above. Then add an equal volume of FBS and incubate the mixtures at 37 °C for predetermined periods (0, 3, 6, 12, 24 h). After that, treat samples with heparin (10 μg/mL) for 15 min to release siRNA . Subject the resulting mixtures to the gel electrophoresis analysis as described above (Fig. [1d](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)). Here recommend naked siRNA as negative control which can be degraded without nanovehicle protection (Fig. [1c](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)).

Prepare same volume of PBS, free siRNA, as well as Lipofectamine wrapped P-gp-siRNA as the control group (*see* **Note** [**5**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_13_Chapter.xhtml#Sec22)). 
3. After 2 days of last injection , extract and ground the tumor tissues in liquid nitrogen after sacrificing the mice.
4. Lyse the tumor tissue power about 0.1 g of each group in 100 μL RIPA buffer added with protein protease inhibitor.
5. After 30 min lysis at 4 °C, collect the supernatants for the western blot analysis by centrifugation of the samples at 10,000 × *g* for 15 min at 4 °C as described above.

## 4 Notes

1. The Alkyl-PEI/SPIO-siRNA complex forming protocol can be employed for multiple siRNA sequences.
2. When forming the Alkyl-PEI/SPIO-siRNA complex for gene transfection, the volume of siRNA solution should be less than or equal to the nanocomposite dispersions.
3. When using Alkyl-PEI/SPIO for other cells siRNA transfection, the seeded cell number is determined by the cell growth rate reaching a confluent of 70–90%.
4. When constructing other luciferase stably expressed cell lines, the dosage and time of antibiotic need to be further screened.
5. When intratumorally inject the agents, about 30 s retention is suggested to prevent the leakage after each injection by using 1 mL syringe with 18 G needle.
