Danyang Li and Khuloud T. Al-Jamal

## Abstract

Owing to the unique physical and chemical properties of carbon nanotubes, they have been widely explored as delivery vectors for proteins, and nucleic acid *etc.* after functionalization. Particularly, the modification of carbon nanotubes suited for the delivery of siRNA has been intensely studied over the past decade. The assay described in this chapter allows for realizable quantification of siRNA binding on carbon nanotube-based materials using gel electrophoresis and silencing by flow cytometry when the siRNA complexes are delivered in vitro.

## 1 Introduction

siRNAs are short stretch dsRNAs, which degrade the complementary mRNA in the cytoplasm. When delivered into cytoplasm, siRNAs are loaded to RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [[1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR1)], which contains Argonaute 2 (Ago-2) that cleaves and releases one strand from the dsRNA [[2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR2)]. The resulting single-strand RNA (guide siRNA) would direct the targeted mRNA through complementary base pairing [[1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR1)]. The targeted mRNA is cleaved by Ago-2 into small pieces, therefore causing mRNA degradation and gene silencing [[3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR3)].

Making use of the unique features of siRNA, several types of siRNA delivery systems such as viral and nonviral delivery systems [[4](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR4)], which include cationic polymers [[5](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR5), [6](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR6)], lipids [[7](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR7), [8](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR8)], nanoparticles [[9](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR9)–[11](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR11)], electroporation [[12](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR12)], microinjection [[13](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR13)], biolistics [[14](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR14)], polypeptide [[15](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR15)–[17](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR17)], and extracellular vesicle [[12](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR12), [18](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR18), [19](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR19)], have been developed in the past decades to efficiently transport siRNAs to the desired destination with minimal adverse effects. The interest in designing nonviral vectors for gene delivery has never waned as they are less hazardous in terms of antigen-specific immune responses compared to viral vectors, although in general transfection efficiency of nonviral vectors are lower [[4](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR4), [20](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR20)]. Encapsulation of naked RNA by cationic polymers [[21](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR21)] or lipids [[22](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR22)] such as Lipofectamine® 2000 have been a major player in commercial products although they present some cytotoxicity [[23](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR23)] and short-term transfection [[24](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR24)].

In recent advances, the design of nanomaterials for the safe and efficient delivery of siRNA is one of the challenging and rapidly growing areas of research since they have to overcome the commonly encountered biological barriers [[25](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR25)]. Among those nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which are rolled up seamless cylinders of graphene sheets have attracted great interests in the field of nanomedicine for the past decades as potential carriers for nucleic acid therapeutics such as siRNA [[9](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR9), [26](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR26), [27](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR27)]. They have been proposed to easily cross the plasma membrane and to translocate directly into cytoplasm of target cells due to their needle-like structure [[26](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR26), [28](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR28)]. Although poor dispersity of CNTs in water is one of the limitations for most of their applications, they offer a structural advantage for further modification owning to their large surface area [[29](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR29), [30](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR30)].

Particularly, covalent and non-covalent functionalization of CNTs have been designed for the purpose of siRNA delivery. The well-known transfection agent polyethyleneimine (PEI) was covalently functionalized onto CNTs and the resulting nanohybrids have shown superior siRNA silencing effect compared to the reference lipidic carrier in the presence of serum proteins [[31](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR31)]. SiRNA complexed with ammonium functionalized CNTs via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides [[32](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR32)] were found to significantly suppress the growth of human lung tumor with intratumoral administration to the animal model, which makes carbon nanotubes potentially favorable for delivery siRNA therapeutics in vivo in comparison with liposome [[33](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR33)]. In terms of more precise tailoring of CNTs for siRNA delivery, Prato et al. [[9](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR9)] reported a direct correlation between amounts of cationic charges on CNTs which was covalently functionalized with quaternary amine dendrons and siRNA that accumulated into cell. The dendron-MWNT constructs have also been shown to complex siRNA and mediate its efficient intracellular delivery and biological activity with minimal induced cytotoxicity by controlling the number of polycationic functional groups on CNTs [[26](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR26)]. Similarly, CNTs covalently functionalized with lipids and natural amino acid-based dendrimers also displayed effective protection for siRNA clearance and silencing for in vivo study [[34](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR34)]. Others have also reported to use lipid for the functionalization of carbon nanotubes for siRNA delivery, but with noncovalent method. For instance, CNTs were noncovalently associated with a lipopolymer-PEI conjugation, in which the lipopolymer binds to CNTs via hydrophobic interaction, resulting in a better dispersity of CNTs in physiological conditions and the exposed PEI was used to offer binding site for siRNA [[35](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR35)]. Unlike the commonly used strategy for complexing siRNA, which was through electrostatic interaction, siRNAs was also reported to couple with phospholipids functionalized CNTs via cleavable disulfide linkage, which can be cleaved by thiol reducing enzymes and promote the release of siRNA from lysosomal lipid vesicles to reach the cell cytosol [[36](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR36)].

To date, many methods have been explored to quantify the silencing efficiency of CNTs based siRNA delivery systems in vitro. Some fluorescently labeled siRNAs [[37](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR37)] have been used to obtain quick estimates of delivery efficiency and localization [[38](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR38)]. However, this approach is neither quantitative nor indicative of siRNA integrity [[39](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR39)] and there is a risk of fluorescence quenching. Recently, a simple FRET electrophoresis method was developed by Tuttolomondo and Ditzel [[40](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#CR40)] to dynamically evaluate serum siRNA stability and its interaction with the serum components, which is vital for in vivo administrations of siRNAs. Common techniques for studying transcriptional efficiency include Northern blotting, real-time PCR, microarray analysis, etc. Other methods to quantify the expression of the corresponding proteins are typically measured with western blot and flow cytometry. There is a need to develop reliable and easy-to-use assays to evaluate the binding and delivery efficiency of carbon nanotube-based systems.

This chapter describes the detailed protocols for siRNA binding and delivery quantification using gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. To quantify siRNA binding, we have used cationic polymer-coated CNTs mixed with siRNA at different N/P ratios, quantified by gel electrophoresis. The siRNA binding of the corresponding free cationic polymer has also been studied where we observed better binding efficiency with cationic polymer functionalized CNTs than the free polymer. The optimal N/P ratio was then used to investigate the siRNA silencing in a model cell line. Commercialized transfection reagent Lipofectamine® 2000 was used as positive control. For quantification of the transfection efficiency, flow cytometry was used with a detailed protocol described in this chapter.

## 3 Methods

### 3.1 Preparation of siRNA Complexes

1. Weigh 5 mg cationic polymer in a 7.5 ml glass vial.
2. Dissolve the cationic polymer with 5 ml of 1× PBS to make the stock concentration of 1 mg/ml.
3. Apply sonication during the dissolution process and make sure the polymer is completely dissolved (*see* **Note** [**5**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).
4. Keep the cap of the vial sealed and stock the polymer solution in the fridge until use.
5. Disperse cationic polymer-CNT in 1× PBS to make the final cationic polymer concentration of 1 mg/ml.
6. Sonicate the sample until it completely disperses in PBS and keep the cationic polymer-CNT dispersion in the fridge until use (*see* **Note** [**6**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).
7. Calculation of N/P ratio for siRNA complex. The N/P ratio is the ratio of amine (N, nitrogen) groups on positively-charged polymer to the phosphate (P) groups on negatively-charged nucleic acid. It is important to determine the N/P of a cationic polymer-based nucleic acid complex as this character can influence many other properties such as the surface charge, size, and stability of the nucleic acid complex. The calculation of N/P ratio is described as follows and the units used are based on the international system of units. Phosphate moles of siRNA: depending on the sequence, siRNA can have 40–42 phosphate atoms per molecule in a 20–21 bp. The total phosphate atoms can be calculated as (*n* × *P*, where *n* is the total number of moles of siRNA taken and *P* is the phosphate atoms per molecule). Nitrogen moles of cationic polymer: the total moles of nitrogen atoms can be calculated as (*M* × *V* × *N*, where *M* is the molarity of cationic polymer stock solution based on the repeat unit, *V* is the volume of cationic polymer taken and *N* is the number of nitrogens in one monomer unit of cationic polymer.) Thus, the N/P ratio can be calculated as: (*M* × *V* × *N*)/(*n* × *P*). Usually, for siRNA loading and transfection assays, the *M*, *N*, *n*, and *P* are known, and thus the *V* can be calculated based on the desired N/P.
8. After calculating the N/P ratio, the siRNA solution (in 1× PBS) and polymer solution/polymer-CNT suspension (in 1× PBS) are prepared separately in two Eppendorf tubes.
9. After 5 min incubation at R.T., the cationic polymer solution/cationic polymer-CNT suspension is added to the siRNA solution dropwise and mixed gently by tapping the tube.
10. The siRNA complex is left at R.T. for another 20 min incubation before performing gel electrophoresis and transfection study.

### 3.2 Gel Electrophoresis for siRNA Binding Capacity

1. Add 2 g agarose powder to 100 ml 1× SBA in a conical flask (*see* **Note** [**7**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).

2. Microwave agarose mixture at full power for 2 min total. Microwave continuously for the first 1 min (*see* **Note** [**8**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)), stop, and swirl flask.

3. Every subsequent 15 s, swirl flask to dissolve agarose clumps until agarose completely dissolves (*see* **Note** [**9**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).

4. Pour the mixture into gel cast, add comb, and leave to set for 30 min (R.T.) or 10 min (4 °C).

5. Transfer agarose and gel cast into running tank.

6. Fill tank with 1× SBA buffer until just covering gel (1–2 mm above the gel) (*see* **Note** [**10**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).

7. Add 1μl of 6× Gel Loading Dye + GelRed to 5μl of sample (siRNA complex or free siRNA in **step 4**, Subheading [3.1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec8) above). Load 6μl sample/ladder into wells on agarose gel.

8. Run gel at constant 225 V for 12 min (*see* **Note** [**11**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).

9. Image the gel with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP™ Imaging System.

10. Calculation of siRNA binding percentage.

The siRNA binding percentage (Fig. [1b](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)) is calculated as follows:

    $$ \mathrm{siRNA}\ \mathrm{binding}\%=100-\frac{\mathrm{intensity}\ \left(\mathrm{siRNA}\ \mathrm{complex}\right)}{\mathrm{internsity}\ \left(\mathrm{free}\ \mathrm{siRNA}\right)}\times 100 $$

### 3.3 Cell Culture

The cells used for transfection assay are dependent on specific experimental design. The following protocol describes the culture of B16-F10 cells (murine melanoma cell line), which is used later in the transfection study.

1. B16-F10 cells were cultured in full-culture medium. Upon confluency, discard the old medium, rinse the cells with 10 ml PBS once, and add 1 ml trypsin-EDTA to cells for 3 min in an incubator (*see* **Note** [**13**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).
2. Add 10 ml of fresh medium to deactivate trypsinization.
3. Collect cells in a 20 ml universal tube and centrifuge at 400 × *g* for 5 min.

### 3.4 Cell Transfection

siRNA (30 nM) is used for transfection assay . Serum-free OPTI-MEM medium is used for preparing siRNA complex and transfection (*see* **Note** [**15**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).

1. Prepare 100μl of siRNA OPTI-MEM solution in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube (*see* **Note** [**16**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).

3. Prepare Lipofectamine® 2000 solution in OPTI-MEM medium according to the manufacturer’s instruction as positive control.
4. After 5 min incubation at R.T., the cationic polymer solution/cationic polymer-CNT suspension/Lipofectamine solution are added to the siRNA solution dropwise and mixed gently by tapping the tube.
5. The siRNA complex (200μl) is left incubation at R.T. for another 20 min.
6. The old medium in 12-well plate containing B16-F10 cells are removed and 1 ml of PBS is added to rinse the cells.
7. 800μl of serum-free OPTI-MEM medium is added to the well.
8. 200μl of siRNA complex is added dropwise to the well.
9. For blank cells, 1 ml serum-free OPTI-MEM medium is added 
10. Incubate the cell for 4–6 h at a cell culture incubator.
11. The serum-free OPTI-MEM medium is changed with full culture medium for a further 24–48 h culture before harvesting. 
12. After 24–48 h culture, the old medium is removed, and the cells are rinsed with 1 ml PBS.
13. 100μl of trypsin-EDTA is used to trypsinize the cell for 3 min in a cell culture incubator.
14. After 3 min, 1 ml of complete medium is added to each well, and cells are collected in polystyrene round bottom 12 × 75 mm2 falcon tubes for further analysis.

### 3.5 Antibody Staining for Flow Cytometry Analysis

The antibody staining protocol (e.g., antibody concentration, staining time, temperature) should be optimized according to the certain types of cells and antibody.

1. The cells harvested in Subheading [3.4](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec11) are washed with PBS and resuspended in 100μl ice-cold PBS with 3% FBS.
2. Transfer 50μl of cell suspension to a new tube for isotype staining.
3. Add 0.1μg/ml of conjugated primary antibody (or the corresponding isotype) to the cell suspension.
4. Incubate at R.T. for 20 min in dark.
5. Wash the cells three times with PBS and centrifuge at 400 × *g* for 5 min (*see* **Note** [**17**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).
6. Resuspend the cells in 200μl of ice-cold PBS with 10% FBS, 1% sodium azide.
7. Keep the cells in fridge until analysis.
8. For best result, analyze the cells with flow cytometry as soon as possible.
9. Fixation of the cells may be needed for cells kept longer than 1 h before analysis (*see* **Note** [**18**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).

### 3.6 Flow Cytometry Analysis for Target Protein Expression

1. Samples collected from Subheading [3.5](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec12) are analyzed with flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, using CellQuest software) using 488 nm excitation and a 585 nm bandpass filter for fluorescein detection (*see* **Note** [**19**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Sec15)).
2. 10,000 events per sample are analyzed.
3. Isotype controls are also analyzed for each sample.

### 3.7 Data Analysis

Subsequent analysis of the target expression is done using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR).

1. A subset of data can be defined through a gate, which is a numerical or graphical boundary that can be used to define the characteristics of particles to include for further analysis. A gate is set on the FSC vs. SSC plot to exclude any debris and allow further analysis of the viable cell population.

2. Using the viable cells gate, another gate of target expression is set on the isotype stained sample to ensure the observed staining is due to specific antibody binding to the target and is not an artifact.

3. The same gate from the isotype sample is applied to the corresponding sample to determine the expression of the target, the representative dot plots are shown in Fig. [2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2).

4. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is exported and relative target expression % (Fig. [3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)) is calculated as follows:

   $$ \mathrm{Relative}\ \mathrm{target}\ \mathrm{expression}\%=\frac{\mathrm{MFI}\ \left(\mathrm{sample}\right)}{\mathrm{MFI}\ \left(\mathrm{blank}\ \mathrm{cells}\right)}\times 100 $$

## 4 Notes

1. Spray the work bench with RNaseZap each time to minimize the degradation of the nucleic acids.
2. Cationic polymer is the same polymer used to functionalize carbon nanotube samples and it may vary according to different purposes. Here we use free cationic polymer as a control to cationic polymer-CNT samples.
3. The properties of cationic polymer used to functionalize CNT and the method of functionalization may vary according to different purposes.
4. Cell culture medium is prepared with 500 ml medium and added supplements for the whole bottle. Aliquots are taken each time for medium warm up instead of warming the whole bottle.
5. Sonicate the cationic polymer and ensure it is fully dissolved in PBS.
6. Sonicate the cationic polymer-CNT samples every time for at least 10 min before use to ensure the well dispersity of the sample.
7. Agarose powder must be uniformly dispersed in buffer prior to hydration to avoid clumping. To determine gel volume using the following estimation: Gel volume = surface area of the casting chamber × gel depth (3–5 mm thick).
8. For smaller or larger volumes, increase or decrease heating times proportionally to volume size.
9. Heating times will vary depending on the wattage of your microwave oven, size of the flask used, and the agarose concentration. Caution: Handle the hot flask very carefully. Microwaved solutions may become superheated and boil over when moved or touched.
10. Allow the agarose solution to cool to ~50–55 °C before pouring the gel into the prepared casting stand. This will result in a gel with a more uniform pore size and prevent warping of the gel apparatus.
11. The voltage and time for gel running may vary according to sample properties and gel apparatus.
12. Use the converted gel image (white background and gray bands) for siRNA binding analysis.
13. Trypsinization time may vary for different cell types.
14. The seeded cell density may vary with different cell type and experiment design. For low-passage cells, make sure cells are healthy and around 80–90% viable before transfection. For high-passage cells, adjust the seeded cell number accordingly and take into account also with the cytotoxicity of the transfection agents. The assay timepoint should also be considered—lower cell densities for long-term assays and higher cell numbers for short-term experiments.
15. siRNA concentration and transfection medium used may vary according to the design of the experiment and also the cell type. Do not add antibiotics to the medium during the transfection as this reduces the transfection efficiency and causes cell death.
16. 100μl siRNA solution is prepared for transfection done in 12-well plate. The amount of siRNA solution may vary according to different well plate applied, and the amount of cationic polymer should also be changed accordingly.
17. This step is to remove any unbound free antibody extensively.
18. For extended storage as well as for greater flexibility in planning time on the cytometer, resuspend cells in 1–4% paraformaldehyde to prevent deterioration.
19. The excitation wavelength and filter may vary according to the specific dye and flow cytometer used.
