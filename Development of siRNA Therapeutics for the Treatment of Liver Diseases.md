Anja Holm, Marianne Bengtson Løvendorf and Sakari Kauppinen

## Abstract

Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapeutics holds the promise to treat a wide range of human diseases that are currently incurable using conventional therapies. Most siRNA therapeutic efforts to date have focused on the treatment of liver diseases due to major breakthroughs in the development of efficient strategies for delivering siRNA drugs to the liver. Indeed, the development of lipid nanoparticle-formulated and GalNAc-conjugated siRNA therapeutics has resulted in recent FDA approvals of the first siRNA-based drugs, patisiran for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and givosiran for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria, respectively. Here, we describe the current strategies for delivering siRNA drugs to the liver and summarize recent advances in clinical development of siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of liver diseases.

## 1 Introduction

The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) and the use of synthetic 21–23 nucleotide (nt) double-stranded RNAs, named siRNAs, to trigger post-transcriptional gene silencing in mammalian cells in a sequence-specific manner have revolutionized functional genomic studies and biomedical research [[1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR1), [2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR2)]. Furthermore, marked improvements in the design, chemical stabilization, and delivery of siRNA molecules have greatly facilitated their therapeutic utility resulting in a diverse pipeline of siRNA therapeutics currently in clinical trials. In 2018, almost 20 years since the discovery of the RNAi pathway, the first siRNA-based drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis [[2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR2), [3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR3)]. In this review, we will describe the different chemical modifications used in siRNA drugs, summarize the currently deployed strategies for delivering siRNA therapeutics to the liver, and highlight recent advances in the development of siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of liver diseases.

## 2 Chemical Modifications in siRNA Drugs

The endogenous RNAi machinery can be engaged by synthetic siRNA molecules to specifically silence the expression of a given target gene for therapeutics. However, unmodified siRNAs are large, polyanionic, and susceptible to degradation by nucleases, which make their clinical use difficult due to poor cellular uptake and rapid clearance in vivo. Furthermore, gene silencing by RNAi-based drugs requires optimization of the siRNA triggers for target specificity with minimized off-target effects and immunogenic reactions due to sensing of double-stranded RNA molecules by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3/7/8 and protein kinase R (PKR) [[4](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR4)], and for improved nuclease resistance. This can be achieved using a variety of chemical modifications of the sugar, the nucleobase, or the internucleotide linkages (Fig. [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)). Commonly used 2′ sugar modifications in siRNA molecules include 2′-*O*-methyl (2′-*O*-Me) and 2′-fluoro (2′-F) [[5](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR5)–[7](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR7)], which enhance serum stability and reduce immune activation of siRNA drugs (Fig. [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)). In addition, structurally constrained bicyclic locked nucleic acids (LNA) [[8](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR8)] and the flexible acyclic unlocked nucleic acids (UNA) [[9](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR9)] have been deployed to increase or decrease, respectively, the binding affinity of siRNAs to their cognate target RNA. Moreover, substitution of phosphodiester linkages with phosphorothioate (PS) linkages, in which a sulfur atom replaces one of the non-bridging oxygen atoms in the phosphate group also improve nuclease resistance (Fig. [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)). More recently, additional chemistries have been applied to enhance siRNA potency and safety. For example, incorporation of a 5′(*E*)-vinyl-phosphonate [[10](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR10)] in the guide (antisense) strand improves the potency and duration of RNAi activity in vivo [[11](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR11)], while incorporation of a (*S*)-glycol nucleic acid [[5](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR5)] modification in the seed region of the siRNA guide strand decreases hepatotoxicity and further improves potency [[6](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR6)]. In addition to the chemical modifications, selection of the siRNA sequence has a major impact on both on-target potency and off-targets activities. For instance, ensuring exclusive selection and loading of the guide strand into the RISC complex is crucial to minimize off-target activities. This can be reinforced by decreasing the thermodynamic stability of the 5′ end of the guide strand by selecting sequences with AU-rich motifs [[7](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR7), [12](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR12)]. Asymmetric siRNAs with a 2-nt 3′ overhang in one end and a blunt end in the other have also been reported to favor guide strand incorporation into the RISC complex [[7](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR7)]. Finally, using LNAs allows the design of small internally segmented inferring RNAs (sisiRNAs), which are characterized by an intact guide strand and a segmented passenger (sense) strand modified with LNAs preventing loading into the RISC complex, thereby minimizing passenger-strand induced off-target effects [[4](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR4)].

Structures of chemical modifications used in siRNA drugs. Commonly used sugar modifications in siRNA molecules include 2′-*O*-methyl (2′-*O*-Me), 2′-fluoro (2′-F), locked nucleic acid (LNA), and unlocked nucleic acid (UNA). Replacement of phosphate backbone linkages with phosphorothioate (PS) linkages increases nuclease resistance of siRNA

The importance of chemical modifications in siRNA drugs is underscored by the results from the ENDEAVOUR Phase III clinical trial (Clinical Trial Number: NCT02319005l). The study showed that revusiran, Alnylam’s first GalNAc-conjugated siRNA drug targeting transthyretin (TTR), had an imbalance in mortality with 18 deaths in the revusiran arm compared with only 2 deaths in the placebo group, as well as increased peripheral neuropathy [[13](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR13)]. The design of revusiran is based on Alnylam’s Standard Template Chemistry (STC), in which the siRNA sequence is fully modified with 2′-OMe and 2′-F sugars and has two terminal PS backbone linkages at the 3′-end of the guide strand. To improve this siRNA drug design, Alnylam developed enhanced stability chemistry (ESC), which includes modifications improving metabolic stability, potency, and duration of action, resulting in decreased dose level and toxicity [[4](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR4)]. The ESC modifications include among others PS backbone adjustments at the 5′-ends of both strands, structural motifs that extend the guide strand to 23 nt, and an augmented number of sequential 2′-*O*-Me modifications [[14](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR14)–[16](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR16)]. Recently, Alnylam reported on the development of the ESC+ system that further improves the specificity and therapeutic index . All siRNA drugs from Alnylam entering clinical studies are based on the ESC or ESC+ design [[17](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR17)].

## 3 Strategies for Delivering siRNA Drugs to the Liver

Development of siRNA therapeutics holds great promise for the treatment of a wide array of human diseases. However, delivery of siRNA drugs is hampered by their high molecular weight (approximately 13–15 kDa) and hydrophilic and polyanionic properties, which prevent naked siRNA molecules to cross the cell membrane. Liver is an attractive organ for the development of siRNA therapeutics since it is amenable to both passive and targeted delivery of siRNAs drugs. Passive delivery exploits the inherent tendency of liposomes and lipid nanoparticles to accumulate in filtering organs of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), primarily the liver, but also lymph nodes, kidney, and spleen [[8](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR8)]. Targeted delivery of siRNAs takes advantage of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), which is expressed at high density on the surface of hepatocytes. Thus, a key focus of RNAi therapeutics has been to develop siRNA drugs for treating liver diseases. Below, we will discuss some representative delivery systems used in the development of siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of liver diseases (Fig. [2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)).

**Fig. 2**

Schematic illustration showing receptor-mediated and passive delivery of siRNAs drugs to the liver. Conjugation of the triantennary GalNAc ligand to the passenger strand of an siRNA enhances delivery to the liver. The siRNA molecule enters the hepatocyte by receptor-mediated endocytosis, where GalNAc binds to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). Upon internalization, the siRNA molecule escapes from the endosome and the guide strand (antisense) is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) facilitate siRNA delivery into the cytoplasm of target cells (hepatocytes) following intravenous (i.v.) administration. Passive delivery benefits from the propensity of LNPs to accumulate in filtering organs of the reticuloendothelial system, including the liver. The LNP encapsulated-siRNA system exploits different lipid components (e.g., PEG-lipid, DSPC, ionizable cationic lipid, and cholesterol) to increase uptake and thereby gene silencing through the RNAi pathway

### 3.1 Lipid Nanoparticles

Lipid nanoparticles (LPNs) have been successfully deployed to deliver siRNA drugs to the liver. Many pharmaceutical companies have developed LNP-based delivery systems typically consisting of 20–200 nm regular LNP structures with a siRNA encapsulation efficiency of over 90%. Using helper lipids such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), DMG-PEG2000, and cholesterol, robust gene silencing in the liver is achievable via the enhanced permeability and retention effect, and penetrate leaky or more permeable vasculature [[18](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR18)]. Consequently, most of the pharmaceutical companies have focused on developing siRNA drugs targeting hepatic genes (Table [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)).

LNPs are divided into two major groups based on the different properties of the key lipids used: (1) cationic LNPs and (2) ionizable cationic LNPs. The positively charged cationic LNPs interact by electrostatic interactions with the polyanionic siRNA, leading to formation of siRNA lipocomplexes with enhanced cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Ionizable cationic LNPs were developed to achieve a system, where efficient encapsulation of negatively charged siRNAs could be accomplished at low pH, but which also exhibited a relatively uncharged surface at pH 7.4 [[19](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR19)]. Interestingly, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) was reported to function as a targeting ligand in an LDL-receptor-dependent manner for ionizable cationic LNPs , thereby enhancing hepatic delivery (Fig. [2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)) [[20](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR20)].

### 3.2 Dynamic Polyconjugates

The first dynamic polyconjugates (DPC) for targeted in vivo delivery of siRNA triggers to the liver were developed by Rozema and coworkers [[21](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR21)]. DPCs comprise four important parts: a delivery platform that can reversibly conjugate a polymer (or polypeptide) with the siRNA, a hepatocyte targeting ligand (*N*-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)), a shielding agent (PEG fragment) to elongate blood retention, and a hydrophobic lipid for enhanced interaction with the cell membrane [[21](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR21)].

The second generation of Dynamic PolyConjugate technology (DPC 2.0) developed by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals relies on cholesterol modifications to facilitate membrane penetration. In this system, a cholesterol-modified siRNA (chol-siRNA) is co-injected with a GalNAc-masked polypeptide due to the ease of manufacturing of the two components separately instead of a single molecule [[22](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR22)]. However, frequent injections with simultaneous delivery of the siRNA trigger and the helper molecules to the target cells involve separate and sequential entry of the components into the blood. Moreover, safety issues, especially immunogenicity, might be a concern due to recognition by TLR 3/7/8 and/or PKR [[23](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR23)].

### 3.3 GalNAc-siRNA Conjugates

A major breakthrough in RNAi medicine was the discovery of targeted delivery of siRNA drugs to hepatocytes via ASGPR in the liver. An oligosaccharide termed GalNAc has high affinity toward the ASGPR receptor allowing selective delivery of GalNAc-siRNA conjugates to hepatocytes [[24](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR24), [25](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR25)]. The use of GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs for liver-targeted delivery is based on binding of the GalNAc moiety to the ASGPR on hepatocytes, which contain ∼500,000 receptors per cell, resulting in rapid endocytosis. ASGPR was discovered in 1965 by Ashwell and Morell, and shown to be predominantly expressed in hepatocytes, but not in other liver cells, such as Kupffer cells [[24](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR24)]. Furthermore, GalNAc, which is an amino sugar derivative of galactose, was shown to possess high affinity to ASGPR. Binding of GalNAc to ASGPR occurs at the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocyte, initially on diffuse monomeric ASGPR receptors, followed by rapid local aggregation of the GalNAc-ASGPR complexes, and larger scale aggregation in clathrin-coated pits, resulting in endocytosis [[25](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR25)]. Early studies noted that the half-life of ASGPR was much longer than the bound asialoglycoproteins [[26](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR26)]. Subsequent studies showed that acidification during endosomal maturation leads to dissociation of the GalNAc ligand from ASGPR followed by degradation of GalNAc in the lysosome and rapid recycling of ASGPR to the cell surface [[27](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR27), [28](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR28)]. Several studies have demonstrated that the GalNAc moiety is able to facilitate efficient cellular uptake of GalNAc-siRNA conjugates by hepatocytes via ASGPR-mediated and clathrin-involved endocytosis, resulting in effective gene silencing with minimal adverse effects (Fig. [2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)) [[14](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR14), [29](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR29), [30](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR30)].

## 4 Development of siRNA Drugs for Treatment of Liver Diseases

Due to the recent progress in liver-targeted delivery of siRNA therapeutics , many biopharmaceutical companies have established extensive pipelines focused on the treatment of liver-related diseases. There are currently 27 siRNA drugs in clinical trials for treating liver diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, hemophilia, hepatic porphyria, amyloidosis, and primary hyperoxaluria (Table [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)). Three pharmaceutical companies, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, have GalNAc-conjugated siRNA drugs for liver diseases in phase II/III and phase III trials. Dicerna has three siRNA drugs in clinical trials, including a phase III study of nedosiran (formerly known as DCR-PHXC) for the treatment of all three known types of primary hyperoxaluria (PH). The three known genetic types of PH result from mutations in three different genes, AGXT, GRHPR, and HOGA1, respectively, in the glyoxylate metabolism pathway [[31](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR31)], resulting in overproduction of oxalate. Nedosiran is a GalNAc-siRNA conjugate targeting the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes the final common step of the glyoxylate metabolism pathway, and thereby prevents overproduction of oxalate. Knockdown of LDH occurs specifically in hepatocytes due to the GalNAc ligand in nedosiran [[31](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR31)]. Data from a phase III study showed a mean reduction in urinary oxalate of 48% (range: 28–59%) among participants with PH1 receiving a single 1.5 mg/kg dose, which led to normalization or near-normalization in the participants, whereas patients with PH2 showed a mean reduction of 24-h urinary oxalate of 42% (range: 22–66%). Nedosiran was generally well tolerated with mild or moderate injection site reactions [[32](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR32)].

Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals has six GalNAc-siRNA conjugates in clinical trials, which includes an ongoing phase II/III study of ARO-AAT for the treatment of the genetic disorder Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) [[33](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR33)]. The most common AATD disease variant, the Z mutant, has a single amino acid substitution that results in accumulation of the mutant protein in globules inside the hepatocytes leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma [[34](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR34)]. ARO-AAT is a cholesterol-conjugated UNA-modified (chol-UNA) siRNA drug targeting the mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin (Z-AAT) for suppressing the liver disease associated with AATD. This siRNA drug is administered concomitantly with the delivery excipient ARC-EX1 containing hepatocyte-targeted GalNAc-conjugated melittin-like peptide, which does not form a complex with the siRNA drug. Results from clinical trial phase I reported a 76.1% reduction in serum AAT 4 weeks after a single 4 mg/kg ARO-AAT dose. No severe adverse events were reported, whereas mild adverse effects included chills in 75% of ARO-AAT group likely related to the infusion of ARC-AAT [[34](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR34)]. The study is currently in phase II/III, where ARO-AAT is administered on day 1, 29, and 113, and every 84 days thereafter in a total of 120 AAT patients [[35](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR35)].

Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has currently 12 siRNA drugs in its clinical development pipeline, of which 11 are GalNAc-siRNA conjugates for a wide variety of liver diseases [[33](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR33)]. Inclisiran (ALN-PCSsc) is based on Alnylam’s ESC-GalNAc drug platform and targets the pro-protein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia by providing sustained reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels upon infrequent dosing. Inclisiran has completed three large double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III studies (ORION-9, ORION-10 and ORION-11), in which 300 mg of the drug was administered subcutaneously on day 1, day 90, followed by s.c. injections every 6 months, leading to a 51% reduction in LDL cholesterol after 1 year [[36](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR36)]. The adverse effects were generally similar in the inclisiran group compared to the placebo group. However, more injection-site reactions (ISRs) occurred in the inclisiran treatment group compared to placebo, but all ISRs were mild and resolved over time [[37](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR37)]. By comparison, hypercholesterolemia patients currently taking statins to lower their LDL cholesterol levels are required to dose every day [[36](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR36), [38](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR38)]. Inclisiran is being developed by The Medicines Company and is expected to achieve regulatory approval in the USA and Europe in 2020.

Lumasiran (ALN-GO1) is an investigational, s.c.-administered GalNAc-conjugated siRNA drug targeting hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (*HAO1*) for the treatment of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1) [[39](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR39), [40](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR40)]. PH1 is a rare disease, which leads to the formation of painful and recurrent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis caused by excessive oxalate production resulting in the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract. Renal damage is caused by a combination of tubular toxicity from oxalate, calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys, and urinary obstruction by calcium oxalate stones [[39](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR39)]. Although a small subset of patients manages the disease with vitamin B6 treatment, the only effective treatment is a combined liver-kidney transplant, which requires life-long immune suppression and carries a significant mortality risk. Results from the ILLUMINATE A phase III study showed significant reduction of oxalate after monthly doses of lumasiran (3 mg/kg) for 3 months followed by quarterly maintenance doses. There were no severe adverse events in the study, and lumasiran was generally well tolerated. Alnylam is also conducting ILLUMINATE B and C, which are studies of lumasiran given to PH1 patients less than 6 years of age and PH1 patients of all ages with advanced renal disease, respectively. Results are expected in 2020 and 2021 [[41](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR41)]. Earlier this year, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Dicerna announced that they have executed a cross-license agreement of their respective intellectual property for lumasiran and nedosiran investigational programs. Moreover, the two companies have decided to form a development and commercialization collaboration on siRNA drugs for the treatment of alpha-1 liver diseases [[42](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR42)].

Vutrisiran (ALN-TTRsc02) is a s.c.-administered, investigational GalNAc-siRNA conjugate targeting transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of transthyretin-mediated (ATTR) amyloidosis. Vutrisiran is similar to the already approved patisiran, but utilizes the GalNAc delivery platform instead of LNPs. Data from clinical phase I showed a TTR knockdown of 83% after a single 25 mg dose of vutrisiran, and a good safety profile with no severe adverse events. The safety and efficacy of vutrisiran are currently being evaluated in the HELIOS Phase III clinical program. Patients will receive either s.c.-administered vutrisiran (total dose of 25 mg every 3 months) (*n* = 120) or intravenously (i.v.) administered patisiran (0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) (*n* = 40) during a treatment period of 18 months. Results from the vutrisiran study will be evaluated with the placebo arm from the APOLLO study for most endpoints, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy [[43](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR43)].

Fitusiran (ALN-AT3sc) targets anti-thrombin 3 (AT3) to enhance thrombin generation (TG) and rebalance hemostasis in patients with hemophilia A (HA) or hemophilia B (HB) with or without inhibitors for the treatment of hemophilia and rare bleeding disorders. Hemophilia is caused by a mutation in the F8 and F9 genes encoding the coagulation factors VIII (FVIII:C) and IX (FIX:C), respectively [[44](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR44)]. Anti-thrombin (AT) is the naturally occurring inhibitor of thrombin, and patients with AT deficiency exhibit a clinically hypercoagulable state leading to thromboembolic events. Moreover, hemophilia patients with a concomitant AT deficiency have less severe bleeding phenotypes compared to patients with normal levels of AT [[44](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR44)]. Fitusiran is administered s.c. once a month, and Phase I and II data showed dose-dependent lowering of AT (20%), increased TG, and a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous and traumatic bleeds [[44](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR44)]. Fitusiran is currently in clinical phase III studies and is being developed by Sanofi Genzyme deploying Alnylam’s ESC-GalNAc siRNA drug platform [[33](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR33)].

## 5 FDA-Approved siRNA Drugs for the Treatment of Liver Diseases

There are currently two FD-approved siRNA drugs on the market, patisiran (ONPATTRO™) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) and givosiran (GIVLAARI™) for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), respectively (Fig. [3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)). Patisiran was approved in 2018 by the FDA for the treatment of polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis and is the first FDA-approved siRNA drug [[2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR2)]. It is an LNP-encapsulated siRNA targeting transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of hATTR [[2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR2)]. hATTR is an autosomal dominant, progressive, life-threatening multisystem disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding TTR. Both mutant and wild-type transthyretin deposit as amyloids in peripheral nerves and the heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, resulting in polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy [[3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR3)]. TTR is mainly produced in the liver and forms homotetramers that transport retinol, thyroxine, and vitamin A. The absence of this protein results in vitamin A deficiency, and thus vitamin A is required as a daily supplement. However, if the protein is present, but misfolded, as occurs subsequent to its mutation in hATTR patients, it generates amyloid fibrils, which deposit in various organs. Treatment options for hATTR prior to the approval of patisiran included orthotopic liver transplantation or the administration of TTR tetramer stabilizing drugs such as tafamidis or diflunisal [[45](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR45)]. However, many patients continue to have disease progression [[3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR3), [46](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR46)].

**Fig. 3**

Schematic illustration of the secondary structures of patisiran and givosiran. (**a**) Patisiran is an LNP-encapsulated siRNA (ALN-TTR02) targeting transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR). All of the pyrimidines in the sense strand and two of the uridines in the antisense strand of patisiran contain 2′-*O*-Me-modified sugars, and both strands contain 2′-deoxythymidine (dT) dinucleotide overhangs at their 3′-ends. (**b**) Givosiran (ALN-AS1) is a GalNAc-conjugated siRNA drug targeting aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). The nucleotides are all chemically modified with either 2′-*O*-Me or 2′-F and the 3′ end of the sense strand is covalently linked to GalNAc to enable specific delivery of the siRNA drug to hepatocytes

Patisiran targets a conserved sequence in the 3′ untranslated region of both mutant and wild-type TTR mRNA, leading to its degradation and a 86.8% reduction in serum TTR protein levels and tissue TTR deposits primarily in the liver [[46](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR46)]. Patisiran (ALN-TTR02) is formulated as a 100 nm LNP composed of the siRNA (ALN-18328) and four lipid components of which two are constituents of other approved drugs (DSPC [1,2-distearoyl-*sn*-glycero-3-phosphocholine] and cholesterol), and two novel lipid components (DLin-MC3-DMA [(6Z,9Z,28Z,31Z)-heptatriaconta-6,9,28,31-tetraen-19-yl-4-(dimethylamino)butanoate] and PEG2000-C-DMG [α-(3′-{[1,2-di(myristyloxy)proponoxy] carbonylamino}propyl)-ω-methozy,polyoxyethylene]) [[47](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR47)]. All of the pyrimidines in the sense strand and two of the uridines in the antisense strand of patisiran contain 2′-*O*-methyl modified sugars with the remaining being unmodified ribonucleotides. Both guide and passenger strands contain 2′-deoxythymidine dinucleotide overhangs at their respective 3′-ends. All internucleotide linkages are natural, unmodified phosphodiester linkages (Fig. [3a](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)) [[3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR3)].

The chemical design of patisiran protects the siRNA and allows passive uptake into hepatocytes upon systemic delivery by i.v. infusion at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Disease progression was halted or reversed with patisiran treatment, which included a transition from assisted to unassisted walking. More importantly, cardiac manifestations of hATTR were also improved. The adverse effects are mostly mild and infusion-related [[3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR3)]. However, seven patients (5%) in the patisiran group died compared to six patients (8%) in the placebo group in phase III clinical trial. The causes of death were primarily cardiovascular in nature and consistent with those expected in patients with hATTR [[3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR3)].

Givosiran is a GalNAc-conjugated siRNA drug targeting aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) for the treatment of AHP [[48](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR48)]. AHP comprises four genetic disorders each caused by distinct enzyme defects in the heme biosynthesis pathway in the liver, leading to abnormal accumulation of toxic heme precursors, such as δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) [[49](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR49)]. This causes acute porphyria attacks that primarily manifest as neurovisceral symptoms such as abdominal pain (cardinal symptom), acute neuropathy, and psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations, anxiety and paranoia [[49](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR49)]. Most symptomatic patients have few attacks in their lifetime; however, up to 5% of patients will have recurrent attacks (≥4 attacks per year). The estimated prevalence of AHP is 5.4 per million individuals [[49](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR49)].

Givosiran is chemically modified with PS backbone linkages, and 2′-OMe and 2′-F sugars, and covalently linked to GalNAc to enable specific delivery of the siRNA drug to hepatocytes (Fig. [3b](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)). This results in knockdown of the liver-expressed ALAS1 mRNA preventing accumulation of neurotoxic ALA and PBG levels that are associated with acute porphyria attacks. Clinical phase III study showed that administration of givosiran by s.c. injections at 2.5 mg/kg once monthly results in dose-dependent knockdown of ALAS1 mRNA (up to 86% knockdown), 91% reduction of the ALA protein and 96% reduction in PBG in the liver, urine, and serum samples. These reductions prevent ALA formation, decrease 5-ALA levels and prevent the production of porphyrins and hemes, such as PBG [[50](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR50)]. After a 6-month treatment, mean ALA and PBG levels were reduced from baseline by 77% and 76%, respectively, and more importantly, the median annual attack rate was significantly decreased by 90% in the givosiran treatment group [[51](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR51)]. In November 2019, givosiran was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with AHP based on the positive results from the multinational, phase III ENVISION trial. In the EU, givosiran received a positive opinion in January 2020 for the treatment of AHP in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older [[51](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR51)].

## 6 Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives

Since the discovery of the RNAi pathway in 1998 [[1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR1)], siRNAs have become a powerful tool for studying gene function and for the development of RNA-targeted therapeutics. Importantly, siRNA-based drugs have several advantages compared to small molecules and monoclonal antibody drugs, which include efficient knockdown of previously undruggable targets, rapid lead optimization, and readily scalable drug manufacturing process. Such features have attracted many researchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop siRNA-based therapeutics. With the emergence of new chemical modifications and improved targeting technologies, the field of RNA therapeutics is experiencing a renaissance. The clinically validated LNPs, GalNAc conjugates, and DPC delivery platforms will continue to produce many new siRNA drugs for the treatment of liver diseases, while ongoing research into new delivery strategies is focusing on effective delivery beyond the liver. Reaching the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS, PNS), respectively, is highly important, due to the unmet medical need for several neurological pathologies. Indeed, recent efforts have shifted toward delivery to the CNS, where strategies to cross the blood-brain barrier include receptor-mediated delivery and intrathecal injections. For example, single well-tolerated intrathecal injections of an siRNA-conjugate in rodent and nonhuman primate models resulted in robust gene silencing throughout the whole CNS, as reported by Alnylam [[52](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml#CR52)]. Other specific administration routes such as intravitreal injection, intratracheal administration, and aerosol inhalation are also being developed for treating ocular and respiratory disorders, respectively. The recent regulatory approvals of ONPATTRO™ (patisiran) and GIVLLARI™ (givosiran) are success stories that will pave the way for the development of new siRNA drugs for the treatment of a wide array of diseases in the coming years.
