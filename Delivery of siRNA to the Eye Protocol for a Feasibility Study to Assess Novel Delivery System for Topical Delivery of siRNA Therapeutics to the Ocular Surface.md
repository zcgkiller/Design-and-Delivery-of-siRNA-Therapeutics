Paulina Baran-Rachwalska Suzanne Saffie-Siebert and C. B. Tara Moore

## Abstract

Drug delivery to the eye remains a real challenge due to the presence of ocular anatomical barriers and physiological protective mechanisms. The lack of effective siRNA delivery mechanism has hampered the real potential of RNAi therapy, but recent literature suggests that nanocarrier systems show great promise in enhancing siRNA bioavailability and reducing the need for repeated intraocular injections. A diverse range of materials are under exploration worldwide, including natural and synthetic polymers, liposomes, peptides, and dendrimeric nanomaterials. This chapter describes a simple workflow for feasibility assessment of a proposed ocular surface siRNA delivery system. Gel retardation assay is used for investigation of optimal siRNA to carrier loading ratio. Fluorescent siRNA allows for initial in vitro testing of cellular uptake to corneal epithelial cells and investigation of in vivo siRNA delivery into mouse cornea by live animal imaging and fluorescence microscopy.

## 1 Introduction

The eye is a particularly attractive target for developing innovative therapies due to its small size and external accessibility for local drug treatment. Moreover, it is quite isolated from the rest of the body, limiting the access of the drug administered into this organ to systemic circulation and minimalizing the risk of possible off-target effects. However, most drugs exhibit difficulties for overcoming the eye-associated barriers, and a delivery of large hydrophilic charged siRNA molecules is particularly challenging. While eye tissues are accessible by injection, it is a very delicate administration route and a noninvasive topical administration is considered preferable, especially for siRNA therapeutics with short in vivo half-life which requires repeated treatment regimen to achieve a continuous ocular presence of intact nucleic acid. However, the ocular surface is a complex biological barrier that has proven challenging for topical drug delivery due to the combined effect of short contact time, the presence of tear film, and the barrier properties of the cornea.

Designing a drug delivery system for topical ocular administration effective in siRNA delivery to the eye is a major challenge for scientists developing RNAi therapies. Broad delivery strategies and a wide range of materials are under exploration worldwide, including natural and synthetic polymers, liposomes, peptides, and dendrimeric nanomaterials. Drug-loading capacity, release rate, and ocular retention time of drug delivery systems would have a great impact on the bioavailability of siRNA at the target site. Herein we describe an easy approach to test the potential of a new carrier system being engineered for topical delivery of siRNA to the cornea . The methodology described could be also adapted for evaluation of siRNA delivery system developed for other anterior or posterior eye tissues.

Commonly used gel retardation assay, also known as gel shift assay, has been adapted to investigate siRNA entrapment by a delivery system and optimize the siRNA loading ratio. The electrophoretic separation of complexes formed with various increasing weight ratios of carrier to siRNA allows to quickly determine if the carrier is capable of binding to a given RNA duplex and identify the optimal loading conditions for the most effective siRNA entrapment.

An efficient internalization of siRNA is a matter of great importance for topical ophthalmic RNAi drug delivery; therefore we present a protocol for testing cellular uptake using commercial siGLO marker. This fluorescently tagged siRNA enables visual assessment of uptake into cornea cells in vitro as well as in vivo imaging. Topical delivery of labeled siRNA into mouse cornea can be assessed by live animal imaging using IVIS Spectrum and further evaluated in eye sections with fluorescence microscopy. Two variants of siGLO transfection indicator are available; however due to distinct spectral properties of green and red fluorophores, performance may differ based on the delivery and detection methods employed. As per manufacturer’s recommendations, siGLO Green (FAM-labeled) represents the ideal choice for studying cellular uptake by microscopy or flow cytometry following in vitro transfection, whereas siGLO Red (tagged with DY-547), which exhibits a stronger signal at lower concentrations, would be a better selection for in vivo imaging.

Pour the gel in appropriate tray with well combs inserted and allow it to solidify (*see* **Note** **1**). 
2. Prepare tested samples of siRNA-carrier formulation at increasing loading ratio (*see* **Note** **2**) in a total volume of 8 μL and an equal final siRNA concentration of 1.25 μM, as described in Table [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_24_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1). Incubate samples at room temperature for 30 min or according to previously optimized conditions (*see* **Note** **3**). 
3. Add 2 μL of 5× loading dye to each sample and mix by pipetting. 
4. Place the agarose gel in a tank filled with 0.5× TBE buffer, remove the comb, and load the samples to the gel wells (10 μL per lane).
5. Run electrophoresis at constant 100 mA for about 40 min (at that point siRNA band should be at about ¾ of a 5 cm gel).
6. Visualize the gel under the UV gel imager . An example of gel imaging output is shown in Fig. 1.

**Fig. 1** Gel retardation assay for optimization of carrier to siRNA ratio. The electrophoretic separation of a carrier-siRNA mixture on agarose gel reflects the fraction of free and complexed siRNA. The unbound siRNA migrates through the gel and shows a band corresponding to free siRNA control (line 1), while the siRNA bound by a carrier system remains immobilized within the wells (line 2–5). The intensity of unbound siRNA band decreases and the intensity of bound siRNA increases with the increasing carrier to siRNA ratio

### 3.4 In Vivo siRNA Uptake into Mouse Cornea

1. Initialize the IVIS .
2. Anesthetize the mouse using 1.5–2% isoflurane in ~1.5 L/min flow of oxygen (setting 2.5 on isoflurane control valve).
3. Place the mouse inside the IVIS Spectrum imager chamber.
4. Acquire image sequence according to the established protocol to measure fluorescence signal (*see* **Note** **6**).
5. Return the mouse safely to the home cage and control while it recovers consciousness.
6. Repeat fluorescence measurement with IVIS (**steps 1–5** above) on a daily frequency for 3 days prior to treatment using all experimental mice. Calculate ocular fluorescence baseline as an average signal intensity for right eye and left eye in separate.
7. On the treatment day, mix siGLO with tested formulation to prepare eye drop samples of 25 μM siRNA-carrier at optimized conditions (*see* **Note** **7**). Also, dilute siGLO with the vehicle buffer to prepare control sample (25 μM naked siRNA).
8. Anesthetize the mouse and apply a 4 μL drop of siGLO-carrier on one eye of the animal and a 4 μL drop of naked siGLO control on the other eye of the animal (*see* **Note** **8**). Allow sample to absorb for 1 min.
9. Return the mouse safely to the home cage and control while it recovers consciousness.
10. Perform fluorescence measurement with IVIS (according to **steps 1–5** above) at least 3 h after the treatment (*see* **Note** **9**).
11. Compare posttreatment ocular fluorescence intensity with baseline measurements (from **step 6**) in separate for treated (i.e., siGLO-carrier) and control (i.e., naked siGLO) eye.
12. After taking in vivo measurements, the fluorescence signal can be further examined in eye sections as explained below.
13. Euthanize the mice using carbon dioxide and gently enucleate the ocular globe from the sacrificed animal. Wash the enucleated eyes with phosphate-buffered saline to remove blood if required.
14. Collect the tissues into labeled tubes filled with 4% paraformaldehyde and fix for 2 h at room temperature.
15. Transfer the collected tissues into tubes filled with phosphate-buffered saline to wash.
16. Place the tissue for a few minutes in PolyFreeze in a labeled small weigh boat (to acclimate the tissue).
17. Transfer the tissue into fresh PolyFreeze in a labeled plastic cryomold (with just enough medium to cover the tissue) and orientate the eye with the cornea facing a side position allowing proper sectioning.
18. Freeze prepared cryomold samples in slush of dry ice and isopentane in a metal container placed in a foam cooler and surrounded with crushed dry ice. Do not fully submerge the samples.
19. Transfer frozen samples to a covered foam cooler filled with dry ice while continuing on to other samples. Wrap all samples in labeled foil and store at −80 °C until further processing.
20. Remove the frozen block from the freezer and allow it to equilibrate to temperature in the cryostat chamber for approximately 30 min.
21. Perform a series of sections 5–10 μm thick using cryostat and collect sections on microscopy slides.
22. Air-dry the slides at room temperature for 1 h.
23. Add a drop of mounting medium with DAPI to cover each tissue section and place a coverslip on top.
24. Incubate the slides for 10 min in the dark.
25. Visualize the slides under fluorescence microscope. Measure red siGLO signal using Cy5 filter and compare with the image of cell nuclei acquired with DAPI filter. An example of imaging output is shown in Fig. 3.

## 4 Notes

1. Use microwave on medium power for approximately 2 min but do not let the solution overflow when boiled. Heat with occasional stirring until solution is clear. Make sure the agarose is completely dissolved (no visible clumps in the solution). Remove the flask from the microwave with a glove and let it cool under tap water until you can comfortably pick it up without protection. 
2. Loading ratio of siRNA to carrier can be expressed in multiple way, such as molar ratio (mol/mol), weight ratio (μg/μg), or commonly used N/P ratio, described as the ratio of positively charged amine (N = nitrogen) groups in a carrier system to negatively charged nucleic acid phosphate (P) groups. Thus, it depends on the investigator how to load siRNA onto carrier system. For a simple demonstration of sample preparation procedure at fixed siRNA concentration and at variable loading ratio, the increasing volume of carrier solution per volume unit of siRNA (v/v ratio) is used in the attached table. 
3. Various factors may have an effect on the process of siRNA complexation with the carrier system, such as type of siRNA-carrier interaction, loading ratio, temperature, physicochemical properties of the carrier, buffer composition, pH, and salt concentration. The procedure of siRNA loading requires optimization for each carrier system. Gel retardation assay described here is a method that may help to optimize loading ratio for a cationic carrier. 
4. Described procedure would result in 50 nM siGLO transfection using a single carrier/siRNA ratio of choice (based on previously performed gel retardation assay). However, it may be necessary to re-optimize siRNA delivery conditions for a certain carrier system in order to maximize transfection efficiency while minimizing cytotoxicity. It is a good practice to perform a screening study using triplicate wells containing siGLO at different concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, or 100 nM) and variable amount of carrier formulation per well.
5. The incubation time can be adjusted and the influence of the incubation time on cellular uptake of siRNA complexed with a certain carrier can be investigated. 
6. Signal acquisition protocol should be optimized for specific application. For siGLO Red detection epi-fluorescence measurement with 535 nm excitation filter and 580 nm emission filter at auto-exposure settings should be most suitable, although we recommend contacting IVIS Spectrum support team for protocol establishment.
7. Prior to advancing to in vivo studies, the formulation should be optimized for ophthalmic use. Most eye drops are sterile, isotonic, aqueous solutions that may contain excipients, which, for example, regulate osmotic pressure, the pH, and viscosity of the preparation. Moreover, the concentration of formulation should be optimized to enable sufficient siRNA dose to be applied within a limited volume of eye drop. Due to a low capacity of conjunctival sac, the volume between 2 and 5 μL should be used for topical installation to mouse eye.
8. Following the implementation of the 3Rs, we recommend using a split body control experiment and compare the formulated siGLO in one eye (tested carrier) with a negative control of naked siGLO (vehicle) in the other eye of the same animal. The amount of siGLO administered shall be constant within the experiment, although the dose may require preliminary optimization.
9. Due to the use of isoflurane for brief anesthesia throughout both topical administration and fluorescence measurement it is recommended to keep at least 3-h break between procedures.
