The major challenge for RNAi-based therapy is the fabrication of the delivery system that meet the requirement of clinical applicability. Liposome-derived nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the best investigated systems for in vivo siRNA delivery. In the recent years, we have successfully redesigned the conventional cationic liposomes into Liposome/Protamine/hyaluronic acid (LPH) NPs and Lipid-Calcium-Phosphate (LCP) NPs in order to increase the in vivo gene silencing effect and reduce the toxicity. Here we describe the preparation of LPH and LCP NPs loaded with siRNA, and characterization analysis including size distribution, trapping efficiency, and in vivo activity.

## 1 Introduction

RNA interference (RNAi) is a revolutionary tool to suppress the expression of the target gene with relevance to any disease. However, the siRNA will have to be delivered to the diseased cells in an efficient manner. The major challenges in achieving efficient siRNA delivery in vivo include low stability in blood serum, rapid excretion by renal clearance, nonspecific tissue distribution, poor cellular uptake, and inefficient intracellular release. Numerous materials have been explored to overcome these multiscale extracellular and intracellular barriers to the delivery of siRNA. Although viral vectors provide excellent in vivo activity of RNAi, safety concerns and difficulties with large-scale manufacture limit their use in clinic. Therefore, nonviral vectors such as liposome-based vehicles have been intensively explored as safe and effective alternatives. The only siRNA drug approved by FDA uses a nonviral vector. Despite the successful examples of using cationic liposomes for in vivo siRNA delivery, their short half-life in plasma and the toxicity of cationic lipids still limit the clinical application. To address these issues, we have redesigned the conventional cationic liposomes by incorporating a “core-shell” structure into the nanoparticles (NPs). This concept was originally developed earlier in our lab for plasmid DNA delivery, which involves pre-complexation of plasmid DNA with protamine sulfate followed by the addition of cationic liposomes. The DNA was condensed by protamine sulfate, a highly positively charged peptide that is approved by FDA for clinical use. When this method was later adapted for siRNA delivery, the cationic polymers formed a looser complex with siRNA than with the plasmid DNA, resulting in formulation of unstable particles and reduced delivery efficiency. Hyaluronic acid (HA), a polyanionic polysaccharide, was therefore employed in order to provide multivalent charges and improve the particle condensation. We mixed siRNA with HA before complexing with protamine. These components spontaneously self-assemble to form NPs. Steric stabilization was introduced by post-inserting PEGylated lipid onto the surface of LPH. LPH demonstrated efficient gene silencing via systemic delivery of siRNA in tumor-xenograft animal models. The sub-cellular distribution study in the cancer cells indicated that the siRNA might be sequestered in the endosomes, and incorporating an endosomal lytic mechanism might further improve the NP formulation. We then formulated the NP core with calcium phosphate (CaP) which could dissolve at the acidic endosome pH. This gave the birth of Lipid-Calcium-Phosphate (LCP) NPs. We proposed and later proved that dissolved CaP significantly increased the osmotic pressure of the endosome and induced swelling and rupture of the organelle, resulting in the release of the encapsulated siRNA. Here we describe methods for preparing siRNA-loaded LPH and LCP. Technical details of preparation and characterization of NPs are presented. This protocol could be used to deliver siRNA into cancer cells.

<span style=color:blue>RNA干扰（RNAi）技术是一种革命性的工具，能够有效抑制与疾病相关的靶基因表达。然而，成功递送siRNA到病变细胞是RNAi疗法的主要挑战。体内高效递送siRNA面临的主要困难包括：血清中的稳定性差、肾脏快速排泄、组织分布不精准、细胞摄取效率低以及细胞内释放不充分。为了克服这些在细胞外和细胞内的多重障碍，已经开发出多种材料来提高siRNA的递送效果。尽管病毒载体在体内具有较好的RNAi活性，但其安全隐患和难以大规模生产的问题限制了其在临床中的使用。因此，非病毒载体，尤其是基于脂质体的递送系统，已成为一种安全、有效的替代方案。事实上，FDA批准的唯一siRNA药物就使用了非病毒载体。尽管阳离子脂质体在体内siRNA递送方面有许多成功案例，但其在血浆中的短暂半衰期和阳离子脂质的毒性依然限制了其临床应用。为解决这些问题，我们对传统的阳离子脂质体进行了改造，在纳米颗粒中引入了“核壳”结构。这一概念最早由我们的实验室提出，用于质粒DNA的递送，方法是先用鱼精蛋白与质粒DNA形成复合物，然后加入阳离子脂质体。鱼精蛋白硫酸盐是一种高度带正电的肽类，已获FDA批准用于临床，它能将质粒DNA有效压缩。当该方法用于siRNA递送时，发现阳离子聚合物与siRNA的结合相对松散，导致颗粒不稳定，递送效率降低。因此，我们引入了透明质酸（HA），一种多阴离子多糖，以增强颗粒的凝聚效果。我们将siRNA与透明质酸混合，再与鱼精蛋白复合，形成纳米颗粒。通过在LPH表面插入PEG化脂质，实现了纳米颗粒的空间稳定性。LPH在肿瘤异种移植动物模型中通过系统性递送siRNA，显示了良好的基因沉默效果。在癌细胞内的亚细胞分布研究表明，siRNA可能被滞留在内涵体中，因此引入内涵体溶解机制可能会进一步提高纳米颗粒的效果。为此，我们将纳米颗粒核心设计为磷酸钙（CaP），其能在酸性内涵体pH环境下溶解，形成了脂质-钙-磷（LCP）纳米颗粒。我们提出并验证了溶解的磷酸钙显著提高了内涵体的渗透压，导致内涵体膨胀并破裂，从而释放出封装的siRNA。本文详细介绍了siRNA载体LPH和LCP的制备方法及纳米颗粒的表征分析，所述方案可用于将siRNA递送至癌细胞。</span>

## 4 Notes

1. Unless stated otherwise, all lipids are dissolved in chloroform to prepare the stock solutions at specific concentrations.
2. Unless stated otherwise, Milli Q water should be used in water and all solutions.
3. Unless stated otherwise, all siRNAs are purchased in the deprotected, desalted, annealed form.
4. The LPH formulation is optimized by fine-tuning the ratio of siRNA, HA, and protamine with different amount of cationic liposomes. The particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro intracellular siRNA delivery are analyzed for optimization. Slightly excess amount of the cationic lipid is required to fully coat the LPH. Further increase of the lipid/siRNA ratio elevates the zeta potential and decreases the delivery efficiency. This might be due to the competitive binding with the cells from the excess cationic liposomes.
5. Postinsertion of DSPE-PEG into the lipid bilayers of LPH is to shield the positive charge and prevent aggregation with serum proteins. The in vivo activity can be further improved if a targeting ligand such as aminoethylanisamide is attached to the surface of the NPs.
6. The particle size, zeta potential, and trapping efficiency of LPH are approximately 120 nm, 25 mV, and 90%, respectively.
7. The particle size, zeta potential, and trapping efficiency of LCP are approximately 40 nm, 0–15 mV, and 40%, respectively.
8. Figure 3 shows the TEM image of LCP with the “core-shell” structure. The coating lipid membrane of the NP could be seen by negative staining (arrows in Fig. 3b). The average size of LCP measure by TEM was about 25–30 nm in diameter, which was slightly smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter (40 nm) obtained by dynamic light scattering since TEM images were obtained under a dehydrated condition. It has been suggested that the optimal particle size for a cancer-targeting nanoparticle carrier is 20–100 nm. Therefore LCP are large enough to avoid renal filtration and small enough to extravasate through the leaky vasculatures in the tumor.
9. The asymmetric structure of the lipid layer is verified by the measurement of zeta potential and the quenching efficiency of a fluorescence lipid marker.
10. Beside the commonly accepted proton sponge effect and ion-pair formation mechanisms, we proposed a CaP dissolution-driven mechanism for cargo release from the endosome. Hypoxia-induced endosome acidification is well known in the tumor cells. Protons will penetrate the lipid membrane of LCP and dissolve the CaP core. The release of calcium ions increased the osmotic pressure and caused endosome swelling and bursting to release the entrapped siRNA. This de-assembly process of LCP has been verified by monitoring the particle size at an acidic pH and fluorescent intensity of Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (a cellular calcium concentration indicator) in cells.
11. Figure [4](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_10_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4) shows the in vivo silencing effect of luciferase siRNA delivered with LCP. The estimated ED50 for LCP-mediated delivery of siRNA is approximately 0.6 mg/kg. Similar studies have been conducted using LPH.
12. Different composition of outer leaflet lipids could be used to coat LCP. When either DOTAP or DOPC was mentioned as the outer leaflet lipid, DOTAP or DOPC was mixed with the same molar amount of cholesterol. The outer leaflet lipid plays an important role in determining the biodistribution of LCP.
13. We have demonstrated that LCP with a neutral (DOPC) or a cationic lipid (DOTAP) exhibited similar level of in vitro silencing effect. However, in vivo studies have indicated that the LCP containing a cationic lipid (DOTAP) delivered siRNA more efficiently than the one containing neutral lipid (DOPC). For the in vivo application, the amount of NP that is delivered to the same endosome might not be sufficient; therefore cationic lipid might still be important for endosome escape.
14. Like LPH, the in vivo activity of LCP could be further improved by using a targeting ligand such as aminoethylanisamide which was tethered to the distal end of PEG. LCP-PEG-AA had a significantly improved silencing effect compared to untargeted LCP-PEG.
15. Compared to the conventional cationic liposomes, the LPH and LCP have a lipid layer supported by the complex core, which could accommodate a higher density of PEGylation, resulting in a better shielding of charge and reduced opsonization by serum proteins. This gives both LPH and LCP a relatively low degree of uptake by the liver and spleen, and a high level of accumulation in the tumor.
16. In vitro study suggested that LCP might outperform LPH in the gene silencing effect. However, since LCP require multiple steps of preparation, while LPH are formulated in a self-assembly manner in a few steps, LPH are now more frequently used in our lab for in vivo siRNA delivery.
