## Abstract 摘要

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are RNA molecules with promising therapeutic potential as a result of their selective mRNA cleavage. However, despite recent progress, low stability in the bloodstream is an impediment to successful administration in vivo. Thus, the availability of flexible and rapid methods for studying siRNA stability and vehicles is crucial for future novel siRNA-based therapeutics. Herein, we report a fast Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) method based on agarose gel electrophoresis to evaluate the stability of siRNA in serum as well as siRNA interaction with serum proteins and enzymes.

## 1 Introduction 简介

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are 20–25 base pairs, double-stranded, noncoding RNA molecules with promising therapeutic potential as a result of their selective mRNA cleavage. siRNA is currently commonly employed in vitro to investigate protein expression. Theoretically, siRNA can be employed in vivo to treat several diseases with much higher selectivity and potency compared to small molecule drugs. However, its administration in vivo is challenging and thus has been the focus of intense recent investigation. Major limiting factors for the clinical use of siRNA are instability of the naked siRNA in the blood due to RNase degradation and removal by immune cells, short half-life due to renal clearance, and low cell and tissue penetration. The siRNA can be chemically modified and associated with a carrier to prolong its stability in the bloodstream and allow efficient cell internalization and tissue permeation.

<span style=color:blue>siRNA（小干扰 RNA）是一种长度为 20-25 个碱基对的双链非编码 RNA 分子，因其选择性切割 mRNA 而具有巨大的治疗潜力。目前，siRNA 常用于体外研究蛋白质表达。理论上，siRNA 可以用于体内治疗多种疾病，与小分子药物相比，具有更高的特异性和效力。然而，siRNA 的体内应用面临挑战，因此近年来备受关注。siRNA 临床应用的主要障碍包括：<br>●  裸露的 siRNA 在血液中不稳定，容易被 RNase 降解和免疫细胞清除；<br>●  由于肾脏清除作用，siRNA 的半衰期短；<br>●  细胞和组织穿透性差。<br>为了解决这些问题，我们可以通过化学修饰 siRNA 并将其与载体结合来延长其在血液中的稳定性，并实现有效的细胞内化和组织渗透。</span>

Tracking the integrity of siRNA in serum is crucial to the design of stable siRNA delivery systems for clinical use. Radiolabeling to evaluate siRNA stability is very sensitive, but expensive, health hazardous, and highly impactful on the environment. Due to these factors, this method is usually reserved for in vivo experiments. For initial estimation of siRNA stability in vitro, most methods are based on the application of fluorescent tags or UV stains (e.g., ethidium bromide) or on the use of siRNA molecules labeled with a single fluorophores. These methods rely on a readout based on a single emission color. Thus, complete degradation of a relatively large amount of nucleic acid is needed to detect either decreased fluorescence or a shifted siRNA band in the agarose gel. The latter methods may lead to incorrect conclusions since they are not sufficiently sensitive to detect partially degraded siRNA. Labeling the siRNA with two distinct fluorescent moieties overcomes this limitation. If the fluorescent tags are chosen as Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs, a fluorophore, and a quenching fluorophore placed on opposing strands of the oligonucleotide, increases the fluorescence emission intensity in the wavelength of the quenched fluorophore upon cleavage. While the fluorescence intensity from the quenching dye is proportional to the amount of cleaved siRNA, this would be unchanged after cleavage and proportional to the total amount of siRNA, allowing normalization of the degraded siRNA vs. total siRNA in the sample. FRET-siRNA can be also administered to cells to evaluate the stability of internalized siRNA and can be employed in plate-based in vitro assays or agarose gel electrophoresis. Although the plate format is suitable when investigating degradation by a single enzyme, it does not allow delineation of interactions with serum components. We recently reported an effective agarose gel electrophoresis method to track siRNA integrity in serum by single-molecule FRET-labeling of siRNA with simultaneous evaluation of interaction with serum components.

<span style=color:blue>跟踪血清中siRNA的完整性对于设计稳定的siRNA递送系统以供临床使用至关重要。放射性标记可以非常灵敏地评估 siRNA 稳定性，但这种方法昂贵、危害健康且对环境影响很大。因此，这种方法通常仅用于体内实验。对于体外初步评估 siRNA 稳定性，大多数方法基于以下几种手段：<br>● 使用荧光标记或紫外染料（例如溴化乙锭）<br>● 使用标记有单个荧光团分子的 siRNA 分子<br>这些方法的检测结果都依赖于单一的荧光发射颜色的读书。因此，需要相对大量的核酸完全降解才能检测到荧光减弱或琼脂糖凝胶电泳条带移动位置的变化。后一种方法由于灵敏度不足以检测部分降解的 siRNA，可能会导致错误的结论。用两种不同的荧光基团标记 siRNA 可以克服这一限制。如果将荧光团选择为 Förster 共振能量转移 (FRET) 对，则将荧光团和淬灭荧光团分别放置在寡核苷酸 的对立链上，则切断后受抑制的荧光团的波长处会增加荧光发射强度。虽然淬灭染料的荧光强度与切割的 siRNA 量成正比，但在切割后不会改变，并且与样品中 siRNA 的总量成正比，从而允许归一化降解的 siRNA 和总 siRNA。FRET-siRNA 还可以用于评估细胞内 siRNA 的稳定性，并可在平板式体外测定或琼脂糖凝胶电泳中使用。虽然平板格式适用于研究单个酶的降解，但它不能区分与血清成分的相互作用。我们最近报道了一种有效的琼脂糖凝胶电泳方法，通过单分子 FRET标记 siRNA 并同时评估与血清成分的相互作用，来跟踪血清中 siRNA 的完整性。</span>

The method relies on a double-stranded siRNA labeled at the 5′-end with the fluorophore carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and at the 3′-end with the quencher carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) (Fig. 1a). The FRET pair TAMRA (Absmax = 557 nm; Emmax = 583 nm) and FAM (Absmax = 495 nm; Emmax = 520 nm) is based on the overlap between the absorption spectrum of TAMRA (acceptor) and the emission spectrum of FAM (donor) (*see* Fig. 1b). When the intact FRET-siRNA is excited in the wavelength of FAM absorption, the emission from FAM is weak due to TAMRA quenching. When degraded siRNA is excited in the wavelength of FAM absorption, the distance between FAM and TAMRA is more extended and the quenching effect of TAMRA decreases, leading to increased intensity of the green fluorescence. In contrast, the red fluorescence is similar for both intact and degraded siRNA.

In this chapter, we will provide detailed protocols to exploit our recently proposed agarose gel electrophoresis of FRET-siRNA for the evaluation of the stability of siRNAs or siRNA-delivery systems. Initially, we describe the design of a FRET-siRNA molecule, and thereafter we provide protocols to employ the FRET-siRNA for the evaluation of siRNA stability in the presence of degrading enzymes (e.g., RNase A) and sera (e.g., fetal bovine, mouse, and human serum) as dose-response and kinetic assays. We also provide a detailed protocol to analyze the gel bands using FIJI ImageJ software.

## 2 Materials

1. 10 μM Double-stranded FRET-labeled siRNA: Design the siRNA based on the desired target mRNA sequence using an available online tool (e.g., siDirect, [http://sidirect2.rnai.jp/](http://sidirect2.rnai.jp/)) to which suitable stabilizing chemical modifications are added. Label with FAM and TAMRA tags at 3′-end and 5′-end, respectively, on each strand of a double-stranded siRNA. In this way, the fluorescent intensity and FRET efficiency will be optimal, and a shift of fluorescence will be observed either in the case of siRNA cleavage or dissociation of two siRNA strands. Fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotides for the sense and antisense siRNA can be obtained from a synthesis service (e.g., GenScript) or produced in house (*see* **Note** [**1**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)). Resuspend the oligonucleotides at 20 μM in RNase-free water. To anneal the two siRNA strands, mix equal volumes of each strand solution, incubate at 65 °C for 5 min, and cool down to room temperature for 30 min. 
2. PBS. 
3. 10 mg/ml (700 U/ml) RNase A. 
4. A vial mixer with thermal control. 
5. High-resolution agarose for Molecular Biology, powder. 
6. 10× TAE buffer: 50 mM EDTA disodium salt, 2 M Tris base, 1 M glacial acetic acid. Add about 800 ml deionized water to a 1 l graduated cylinder or a glass beaker. Weigh 242 g Tris base and transfer to the cylinder. Add 18.61 g of disodium EDTA to the solution. Add 57.1 g Acetic Acid to the solution. Add deionized water to 900 ml. Mix and adjust pH with NaOH.

12. Gel imager with the possibility of setting the excitation at 465 nm and the emission detection at 600 nm for TAMRA and 520 nm for FAM (*see* **Note** [**4**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)). 
13. FIJI ImageJ (NIH) software (available for free of charge download at [https://imagej.net/Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji)). 

## 3 Methods

### 3.1 Validation of Designed FRET-siRNA by RNase A Digestion

1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer with an 8-wells comb (*see* **Note** [**5**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)).
2. Set the thermomixer at 37 °C. 
3. Prepare eight Eppendorf tubes containing 7.5 pmol (22 μg) FRET ds-siRNA in PBS: add 2.5 μl of 10 μM siRNA to 6.5 μl of PBS (*see* **Note** [**6**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9) and Table [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)). 
4. Prepare serial dilutions of RNase A from the 10 mg/ml stock solution according to Table [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1). 
5. Add 1 μl of corresponding RNase A solution according to Table [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1). 
6. Incubate the samples at 37 °C for 2 min with shaking. 
7. Add 2 μl of sample loading solution to each sample and load them on the agarose gel according to the sample number. 
8. Perform the electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer at 120 V for about 10 min. 
9. Image the gel using a fluorescence gel imager. Excitation should be close to 465 nm for both fluorophores. Detection should be close to 520 nm for FAM and close to 600 nm for TAMRA. The suggested exposure time is 15 s (*see* **Note** [**7**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)).

#### 3.1.1 Evaluating Band Fluorescence Intensity by FIJI ImageJ Gel Analyzer Tool

1. Import the images to FIJI ImageJ and assign the red channel to TAMRA and the green channel to FAM. 

2. Convert the image to 8-bit (go to Image, Type, 8-bit) to obtain a grayscale image of the gel. 

3. Choose the Rectangular Selections tool from the ImageJ toolbar. 

4. Draw a rectangle around the first lane. 

5. Go to Analyze, Gels, Select First Lane to set the selection as “first lane.” A number 1 will appear over the first lane selection. 

6. Move the rectangle selection to the next lane (*see* **Note** [**8**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)). 

7. Go to Analyze, Gels, Select Next Lane to set the selection as “second lane.” A number 2 will appear over the second lane selection. 

8. Repeat **steps 6** and **7** for the remaining lanes of the gel. 

9. Go to Analyze, Gels, Plot Lanes to obtain a profile plot of each lane. A pick will correspond to each lane. 

10. Choose the straight-line selection tool from the ImageJ toolbar. 

11. Draw a line across the base of each peak to enclose the peak and remove the background noise. 

12. Use the wand tool from the toolbar to click inside each peak. The measurements of the pick areas will appear in the Results window. The results can be exported to a spreadsheet. 

13. Repeat the procedure for each channel (FAM and TAMRA). 

14. Create a merged image (*see* **Note** [**9**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9) and Fig. [2a](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)) [[26](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#CR26), [27](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#CR27)]. 

15. The amount of degraded siRNA is proportional to the FRET efficiency. Calculate the ladder as “relative ratiometric FRET efficiency,” or “relative proximity ratio,” EPR by using Eq. [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Equ1) as from Eyal Nir et al. [[28](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#CR28)]:

    $$ {E}_{\mathrm{PR}}=\frac{I_{\mathrm{A}}}{I_{\mathrm{A}}+{I}_{\mathrm{D}}}-\frac{I_{\mathrm{A}}^0}{I_{\mathrm{A}}^0+{I}_{\mathrm{D}}^0} $$         (1)

    Factors on Eq. [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Equ1) have been defined in our previous work “*I*A is the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor, *I*D is the fluorescence intensity of the donor, $$ {I}_{\mathrm{A}}^0 $$is the minimum fluorescence intensity of the acceptor, and $$ {I}_{\mathrm{D}}^0 $$ is the minimum fluorescence intensity of the donor” [[25](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#CR25)].

16. Plot the relative ratiometric FRET efficiency against the RNase A amount (Fig. [2b](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)).

### 3.2 Tracking the Integrity of FRET-siRNA in Different Percentages of Serum and Evaluating Interaction with Serum Components

1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer with a 10-wells comb.

2. Set the thermomixer at 37 °C.

3. Prepare 10 samples of FRET ds-siRNA in PBS from 10 μM solution according to Table [2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2).

4. Treat with the serum of interest (e.g., human, mouse, fetal bovine serum) at a final concentration ranging from 1% to 50% according to Table [2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2).

5. Incubate for 2 min at 37 °C with shaking. 

6. Perform electrophoresis, imaging, and analysis as described in Subheading [3.1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec4).

7. A strong gel shift of FAM and TAMRA bands indicates interaction with serum components. An individual shift of FAM band indicates interaction with serum RNases during degradation. Figure [3a–d](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3) show the result obtained when degrading a FRET-siRNA with goat, mouse, fetal bovine, and human serum, respectively. 

8. Plot the corresponding relative ratiometric FRET efficiency against serum percentage (*see* Fig. [3e](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)).

### 3.4 Evaluation of FRET-siRNA Stabilizing Effect of siRNA Carriers in Serum

1. Prepare a 2% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer with a 4-wells comb. 

2. Set the thermomixer at 37 °C. 

3. Prepare two samples of FRET ds-siRNA in PBS from 10 μM solution at a final concentration 1.5 μM. One sample will be untreated free siRNA and the other serum-treated free siRNA. 

4. Prepare two samples of FRET ds-siRNA encapsulated with the tested carrier according to standard lab protocol. One sample will be untreated FRET-siRNA+carrier and the other serum-treated FRET-siRNA+carrier. 

5. Add serum of interest to the samples to be treated at a chosen final percentage. Add the same volume of PBS to the untreated samples. 

6. Incubate all samples at 37 °C for a desired time (*see* **Note** [**10**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)). 

7. Release the FRET-siRNA from the carrier by adding a releasing agent. For peptides and Lipofectamine 2000, dextran sulfate sodium is suggested to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. 

8. Perform electrophoresis, imaging, and analysis as described in Subheading [3.1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec4) (*see* Fig. [5a](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5) and **Note** [**11**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)).

9. For each sample, normalize the relative ratiometric FRET efficiency value to the value from the corresponding untreated sample.

10. Graph the normalized relative ratiometric FRET efficiency to compare the stabilizing effect of the carrier to the free FRET-siRNA degradation (*see* Fig. [5b](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5)).

## 4 Notes

1. As sense and antisense siRNA, we employed the following oligonucleotide sequences: FAM-5′-GGUCUAGCUACAGAGAAAU-3′-TAMRA (sense siRNA strand); FAM-5′-AUUUCUCUGUAGCUAGACC-3′-TAMRA (antisense siRNA strand). We suggest purifying the oligonucleotides by RNase-free HPLC. 

2. We suggest using a custom-made sample loading solution without dye since we observed that most dyes would run on top of the siRNA band, reducing the detection efficiency. 

3. As stabilizing agents, we employed lipofectamine 2000 (Thermofisher), 0.5 mM TAT peptide (Genscript, GRKKRRQRRRPQ), and 1 mM SRCRP2-11R peptide (obtained by custom-made synthesis at 95% purity from Genscript, GRVRVLYRGSW). 

4. We used Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS, PerkinElmer). 

5. The gel should be prepared without addition of any nucleic acid stain (e.g., Ethidium Bromide, Gel Red). Indeed, the imaging of the siRNA on the gel will rely on the presence of the fluorophores. Please note that for small oligonucleotides, a high percentage agarose gel is usually suggested to obtain a good resolution of the ladder. In this experiment, the ladder is not needed and we recommend employing a low-resolution gel to reduce the agarose background. 

6. Work in a RNase-free area and keep all tubes in ice. Please note that in Table [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1) samples are numbered after the loading order on the agarose gel. 

7. Exposure time should be optimized based on gel thickness and instrument features. We recommend testing different exposure times before saving a protocol in the machine. 

8. To move the rectangular selection to the next lane, you can use the mouse or the arrows on the keyboard. Do not create a new rectangular selection as the selection must be exactly the same size for all lanes. 

9. As visible in Fig. [2a](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2), if the resolution of the gel is high, it is possible to observe a slight shift of the siRNA band in parallel with fluorescence color shift that is due to the siRNA degradation. 

10. We have encapsulated our FRET-siRNA with peptide SRCRP2-11R, peptide TAT, and lipofectamine 2000 (Thermofisher) in 1% human serum for 30 min. 

11. For this assay, we observed that using completely degraded FRET-siRNA as a positive control could result in an overexposed band from a strong fluorescence intensity of FAM, which could lead to an increased background in the close lanes. To avoid this, we suggest leaving one empty well between samples when loading the agarose gel.
