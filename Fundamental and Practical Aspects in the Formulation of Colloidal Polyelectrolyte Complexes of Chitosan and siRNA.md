Christophe Schatz and Tim Delas

## Abstract 摘要

The formation of electrostatic interactions between polyanionic siRNA and polycations gives an easy access to the formation of colloidal particles capable of delivering siRNA in vitro or in vivo. Among the polycations used for siRNA delivery, chitosan occupies a special place due to its unique physicochemical and biological properties. In this chapter we describe the fundamental and practical aspects of the formation of colloidal complexes between chitosan and siRNA. The basis of the electrostatic complexation between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes is first introduced with a focus on the specific conditions to obtain stable colloid complex particles. Subsequent, the properties that make chitosan so special are described. In a third part, the main parameters influencing the colloidal properties and stability of siRNA/chitosan complexes are reviewed with emphasis on some practical aspects to consider in the preparation of complexes.

## 1 Introduction 前言

The main approach to design nonviral vectors of siRNA relies on the electrostatic complexation of the negative charges of the siRNA backbone with positive charges carried by lipids or polymers. The positive charges arise from amine groups protonated at physiological pH or quaternized amine groups that are charged at any pH. When the complexation between siRNAs and cationic lipids or polymers is carried out under appropriate conditions of concentration, charge ratio, and pH, the complex particles formed have colloidal sizes compatible with systemic administration. The electrostatic interaction ensures a high loading of siRNA without losses during the process which is advantageous in comparison to other encapsulation processes. The adjunction of specific chemical groups in the lipid or polymer structure endows the synthetic vector with biological functionalities of interest like cell targeting, cell internalization, or endosomolytic activity. However, the use of synthetic cationic polymers like polyethyleneimine, polyamidoamine, or poly(L-Lysine) faces some toxicity issues which considerably limits their applications for human therapy. In this context the design of synthetic vectors from naturally occurring materials is highly desirable. Due to their biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and great variety of properties, polysaccharides are materials of interest for biological applications. Among them, chitosan is unique because it is the only native polysaccharide containing amine groups. It is thus obvious that chitosan has been extensively studied for its complexing properties with nucleic acids. Other polysaccharides can be cationized into chitosan-like polymers by chemical modification of functional groups on the polysaccharide chain but they have been less used than natural chitosan for the delivery of nucleic acids.

<span style=color:blue>设计siRNA非病毒载体的核心策略是利用siRNA骨架的负电荷与脂质或聚合物所携带的正电荷之间的静电复合作用。这些正电荷通常来自在生理pH条件下质子化的胺基，或在任何pH条件下均带正电的季铵基。当在适宜的浓度、电荷比及pH条件下进行siRNA与阳离子脂质或聚合物的复合时，形成的复合颗粒具有胶体大小，能够满足系统给药的要求。与其他包封工艺相比，静电相互作用能够显著提高siRNA的负载效率，避免加工过程中出现损失。此外，通过在脂质或聚合物分子中引入特定的化学基团，可以赋予人工载体多种生物功能，包括细胞靶向、细胞内吞或溶内体活性。然而，合成阳离子聚合物（如聚乙烯亚胺、聚酰胺胺或聚L-赖氨酸）的毒性问题显著限制了其在人体治疗中的应用。在此背景下，基于天然材料设计的载体成为理想选择。由于其优异的生物相容性、亲水性以及多样的理化特性，多糖类材料在生物学应用中备受关注。其中，壳聚糖因其是唯一含有胺基的天然多糖而显得尤为独特。壳聚糖与核酸的复合特性已被深入研究。此外，其他多糖可以通过化学修饰其多糖链上的官能团转化为类似壳聚糖的阳离子聚合物，但相比天然壳聚糖，这些改性多糖在核酸递送中的应用仍显有限。</span>

This chapter focuses on the preparation of colloidal polyelectrolyte complexes of chitosan and siRNA with both fundamental and practical physicochemical aspects. Only native chitosan is considered here, mainly for two reasons. Firstly, native chitosan has remarkable physicochemical properties that deserve to be used without having to modify its chemical structure, which in any case would alter its biological integrity. Second, a good understanding of the physical chemistry of the complexation of native chitosan with siRNA is a necessary prelude to study complexes obtained from chemically modified chitosans. In addition, excellent review papers have already reported on the state of the art of chitosan-based siRNA delivery systems including those based on modified chitosans.

<span style=color:blue>本章主要探讨了壳聚糖与siRNA胶体聚电解质复合物的制备过程，涵盖了基本理论和实践中的理化方面。本文仅关注天然壳聚糖，原因有二。首先，天然壳聚糖具有优异的理化特性，足以支持其直接用于siRNA递送，而无需化学改性，因为任何结构上的修改都可能影响其生物学完整性。其次，深入理解天然壳聚糖与siRNA复合的物理化学机制，是进一步研究化学修饰壳聚糖所得到复合物的基础。此外，已有大量的综述文章深入探讨了壳聚糖基siRNA递送系统的研究现状，尤其是改性壳聚糖在其中的应用。</span>

The first section of the chapter deals with the electrostatic complexation of polyelectrolytes which is the main approach considered here to form colloidal siRNA delivery systems. The goal is to give the reader the important facts about the morphology, kinetics, and thermodynamics of polyelectrolyte complexes that can apply to any types of polyelectrolytes, synthetic or natural ones including chitosan and siRNA. A focus is also made on the specific conditions required for the formation of stable complex nanoparticles in aqueous media. In the second part, some important aspects related to chitosan and its solution properties are introduced. Chitosan does not behave as a regular polyelectrolyte, as evidenced by its low cationicity, its behavior strongly dependent on the degree of acetylation and its propensity to form aggregates. The main trends observed in the complexation behavior of chitosan with a model polyanion are also summarized in order to introduce the formation of nanosized complexes from chitosan. The third and main section deals with the electrostatic complexation of chitosan with siRNAs to form submicron-sized colloidal particles. The complexation thermodynamics and the colloidal aspects are described with emphasis on some important practical considerations.

## 2 General Aspects of the Polyelectrolyte Complexation 聚电解质复合的一般情况

### 2.1 Weak and Strong Polyelectrolyte Complexes 弱聚电解质复合物和强聚电解质复合物

Polyelectrolytes (PEs) are polymers containing ionic or ionizable groups. PEs can be classified as polyanions, polycations, or polyampholytes depending on whether the chains carry negative, positive charges or both. They can also be classified as strong or weak whether they are charged at any pHs or in a limited pH range. PEs of opposite charges interact through electrostatic interaction to form complexes. The complexation is thermodynamically favored by the decrease of the Coulomb energy of PEs due to the charge pairing and the large entropy gain due to the release of counterions and water molecules initially bound to charges. Secondary interactions like hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, or van der Waals forces may also take place. However, the electrostatic contribution generally dominates the interaction between the PEs. For example, it was shown by titration calorimetry that the electrostatic interaction represents approximately 90% of the total binding free energy of polycation-DNA complexes. The polyelectrolyte complexation has a cooperative character, i.e., the stability of the complexes increases with the chain length of the PEs. This can be explained by considering that the loss of translational entropy of PE chains is highest for the first binding between two oppositely charged units but then becomes less important for the binding of the neighboring units. Therefore, the complexation reaction proceeds according to a zipping mechanism. When the total free energy change exceeds the kinetics energy of the polymer chains, a stable complex is formed. This condition is generally achieved when the PE chains contain a minimum of 5–8 units as found for various charged polymers including DNA. For comparison, hydrogen-bonded complexes require at least 40 monomer units, the bonding energy being much lower than for electrostatic complexes. The cooperativity character of the complexation is important in that it allows the formation of stable complexes even under dilute conditions.

<span style=color:blue>聚电解质（PEs）是含有离子或可离子化基团的高分子。根据链段携带的电荷类型，聚电解质可分为聚阴离子、聚阳离子或聚两性电解质，具体取决于它们带有负电荷、正电荷或两者兼有。此外，聚电解质还可以根据其在不同pH条件下的带电行为分为强聚电解质和弱聚电解质，前者在所有pH值下均可带电，而后者则仅在有限的pH范围内带电。带有相反电荷的聚电解质通过静电相互作用形成复合物。复合化过程通过电荷配对引起聚电解质之间的库伦能量降低，并通过释放最初与电荷结合的对离子和水分子产生显著的熵增，从而使复合过程热力学上得以促进。除了静电作用外，次级相互作用，如氢键、疏水效应和范德华力，也可能参与其中。然而，静电作用通常主导着聚电解质间的相互作用。例如，通过滴定量热法研究表明，静电相互作用大约占聚阳离子-DNA复合物总结合自由能的90%。聚电解质复合反应具有协同特性，即随着聚电解质链长的增加，复合物的稳定性也相应增强。这可以通过聚电解质链的平移熵损失来解释：在首次结合两个带电单元时，损失最大；而在相邻单元之间结合时，损失的影响则较小。因此，复合反应呈现出拉链机制。当总自由能变化超过聚合物链的动力学能量时，稳定复合物便会形成。通常，聚电解质链需要包含至少5-8个单元，类似于DNA等带电高分子的情况才能满足这一条件。相比之下，氢键复合物至少需要40个单体单元，并且其结合能远低于静电复合物。复合反应的协同特性非常重要，因为它使得即使在稀释条件下，也能够形成稳定的复合物。</span>

It is interesting to question the physical state of PE complexes, i.e., whether the complexes are solid-like or liquid-like (Fig. 1) . Although there is no theory yet to answer this fundamental question, the physical state can be simply assessed by observing the system at the charge stoichiometry where the interaction between PEs is maximized. Either a solid precipitate or a dense liquid phase should be seen to settle at the bottom of the tube. For very dilute systems, solid aggregates or micron-sized droplets should be observed by light microscopy. In a solid-like complex, the charges of PEs are in strong interaction with a complete release of counterions and water molecules. The complex behaves as a hydrophobic, dry material in which polymer chains have lost their mobility. In a liquid-like complex, also referred as complex coacervate, the interaction between the PEs is much weaker. The electrostatic bonds are only transient and the charges remain hydrated giving a high mobility to PE chains. Note that the term “coacervate” is often misused for any types of polyelectrolyte complexes. The reason why PEs can form either solid (strong) or liquid (weak) complexes is mainly due to the initial hydration of the PE chains. PEs with a large hydration shell tend to form weak complexes because the water molecules coordinated to the charges oppose the pairing of charges, resulting in a loose and still hydrated complex structure. Other factors such as the ionic strength, the nature of counterions, the temperature, or the dielectric constant of the medium can also influence the type of complex obtained. Thus, polyelectrolyte complexes form a continuum of morphologies, in relation with the total intensity of the interaction that can be varied by different means.

<span style=color:blue>聚电解质（PE）复合物的物理状态，即它们是呈固体状还是液体状（见图1），是一个值得深入研究的问题。虽然目前尚无成熟理论能够解答这一基本科学问题，但可以通过简单的实验观察来评估其物理状态。当聚电解质的电荷达到化学计量比，即两者之间的静电相互作用达到最大时，体系中可能会出现固体沉淀或沉积于管底的浓稠液相。在非常稀释的体系中，通过光学显微镜可以观察到固体聚集体或微米级液滴的存在。对于固体状复合物，聚电解质之间的电荷相互作用非常强，对离子和水分子被完全释放，复合物表现为一种疏水且干燥的材料，高分子链因此失去流动性。而液体状复合物（通常称为复合共沉物）则表现出较弱的聚电解质相互作用，电荷之间的静电结合仅为瞬时状态，电荷保持水化，从而使PE链具备较高的流动性。需要特别指出，“共沉物”这一术语常被误用来描述任何类型的聚电解质复合物。聚电解质能够形成固体或液体复合物的主要原因在于其初始水化状态的不同。具有较大水化壳层的聚电解质往往倾向于形成较弱的复合物，因为电荷所结合的水分子阻碍了电荷之间的配对，从而形成松散且仍保持水化的复合结构。此外，诸如离子强度、对离子的特性、温度和介质的介电常数等因素同样会显著影响复合物的类型。因此，聚电解质复合物在形态上可以呈现连续变化，其具体表现取决于通过不同方法调控的相互作用强度。</span>

**Fig. 1** Main characteristics of strong and weak polyelectrolyte complexes. Some variations are possible according to the chemical system considered

Strong and weak complexes have distinctive thermodynamic signatures. For strong complexes, the electrostatic interaction leading to the formation of tight ion-pairs give rises to a typical negative enthalpy of complexation (exothermic) whereas for weak complexes, the hydration forces opposing the electrostatic interaction are often at the origin of a positive enthalpy of complexation (endothermic). Considering, as a first approximation, that the entropy gain is similar for both types of complexes, the absolute value of the free energy and the associated complexation constant (K) are much higher for strong complexes than for weak complexes. As a result, in salt-free solutions, strong complexes tend to form frozen structures far from thermodynamic equilibrium while weak complexes are more likely to form equilibrium structures. This has practical implications for the preparation of complexes. Indeed, the complexation reaction being an extremely fast process (<5 μs, i.e., nearly the diffusion-collision time of PE chains), experimental factors like the PE concentration, the mixing time, the charge ratio can greatly influence the final morphology of strong complexes while they exert little or no influence on weak complexes (coacervates). In other words, the PE complexation proceeds under kinetic control for strong complexes and thermodynamic control for weak complexes. Since complexes obtained from nucleic acids are often of the strong type as judged by their typical negative enthalpy of complexation, their final structure is typically under kinetic control and thus dependent on the initial conditions.

<span style=color:blue>强复合物与弱复合物在热力学特征上存在显著差异。对于强复合物，由静电作用引发的紧密离子对形成通常伴随典型的负焓变化（放热反应）；而对于弱复合物，水化力对静电作用的抗衡往往是正焓变化（吸热反应）的主要来源。假设两类复合物的熵增相似，则强复合物的自由能绝对值及其复合常数（K）远高于弱复合物。因此，在无盐溶液中，强复合物通常形成远离热力学平衡的冻结结构，而弱复合物则更倾向于形成热力学平衡结构。这种差异在复合物的制备过程中具有重要的实际意义。复合反应的速度极快（<5 μs，接近聚电解质链扩散碰撞的时间），因此，实验条件如聚电解质浓度、混合时间和电荷比等因素，会显著影响强复合物的最终形态，但对弱复合物（如共沉物）的影响微乎其微。换言之，强复合物的形成过程受到动力学控制，而弱复合物则更多地受到热力学控制。由于核酸复合物通常被认为是强复合物（从其典型的负焓变化可以判断），其最终结构通常由动力学因素决定，因此高度依赖于初始反应条件。</span>

### 2.2 Colloidal Polyelectrolyte Complexes 胶体聚电解质复合物

The complexation of polyelectrolytes is well suited to the design of colloidal particles as those used in gene delivery applications. The particle forming process relies on the charge neutralization of PE segments followed by their segregation through hydrophobic interaction into small aggregates stabilized by free unpaired charges (Fig. 2) . PE systems forming either solid or liquid-like complexes can be used to form particles, the particle core being more hydrophobic and compact in the case of strong complexes. Two conditions are generally required to obtain stable particles of complex in aqueous solutions: (i) a relatively low PE concentration (<1 wt. %) to avoid uncontrolled complexation and (ii) an excess of one of the two PEs to have unpaired charges at particle surface. By assuming at first glance a complexation stoichiometry of 1:1 between cationic and anionic monomer units , the charge excess of complex particles can be predicted from the mixing ratio, *Z* = [+]/[−] which corresponds to the molar ratio between cationic and anionic units of PEs introduced in the medium. Thus, positively charged complexes are formed at *Z* > 1 and negatively charged complexes at *Z* < 1. It is worth to notice that *Z* slightly differs from the nitrogen to phosphate ratio (N:P) used for nucleic acid complexation as the latter does not take into account the ionization rate of amine groups. The complex particles have typical sizes in the 50–500 nm diameter range with levels of aggregation reaching up to several thousand chains. The level of aggregation is essentially controlled by the concentration of PEs, higher concentrations systematically favoring the formation of bigger particles. Structural parameters of PE chains such as the chain length, the charge density and the chain flexibility also impacts on the particle size in such a way that all factors favoring the charge pairing between opposite PEs lead to complexed segments with a high density of neutral ions pairs, resulting in highly neutralized complexes and hence to small particle sizes. Furthermore, better particle stabilization is achieved when the polymer in excess is of higher molar mass than its default counterpart as this favors the formation of a larger outer shell (Fig. 2). The addition of salt leads to subtle effects. For relatively low salt concentrations, the screening effect of the salt makes the PE chains more flexible and the interaction between opposite PEs weaker. Consequently, the charge complexation is favored by conformational adaptation of PE chains which leads to a lower level of aggregation. For higher salt concentrations, the screening of the charged, stabilizing shell of the excess component leads to aggregation of particles which can be irreversible. In the specific case of weak complexes, the addition of a high salt concentration cause their dissolution rather than aggregation.

<span style=color:blue>聚电解质（PE）的复合作用非常适用于设计基因递送中的胶体颗粒。颗粒的形成基于PE片段电荷的中和，并通过疏水相互作用聚集成小型聚合体，这些聚合体由未配对的自由电荷稳定（图2）。无论是固态还是液态复合物系统均可用于颗粒的制备，其中强复合物的颗粒核心通常表现出更高的疏水性和更紧密的结构。为了在水溶液中制备稳定的复合颗粒，通常需要满足以下两个条件：（i）较低的PE浓度（<1 wt.%），以避免发生不可控的复合作用；（ii）一方聚电解质的过量以在颗粒表面提供未配对电荷的稳定性。在假设阳离子与阴离子单体单元复合化学计量比为1:1的前提下，复合颗粒的电荷过量情况可以通过混合比*Z* = [+]/[−]预测，其中*Z*为介质中阳离子与阴离子单元的摩尔比。当*Z* > 1时形成带正电的复合颗粒，而*Z* < 1时则形成带负电的复合颗粒。需要注意的是，*Z*与核酸复合中常用的氮磷比（N:P）不同，后者未考虑胺基的离子化程度。复合颗粒的尺寸通常在50–500 nm范围内，其聚合水平可高达数千条链。聚合水平受PE浓度显著影响，较高浓度往往促进更大颗粒的形成。此外，PE链的结构特性（如链长、电荷密度和链柔性）也会显著影响颗粒的尺寸：有利于阳离子与阴离子电荷配对的因素会产生高度中和的复合片段，从而生成更小的颗粒。值得一提的是，当过量聚合物的分子量高于另一方时，更大的外壳形成会增强颗粒的稳定性（图2）。盐的加入对复合作用的影响因浓度而异。在较低盐浓度下，盐的屏蔽效应可使PE链更具柔性，同时降低相反电荷间的静电相互作用，从而通过链的构象适应促进电荷中和并降低颗粒的聚合程度。而在较高盐浓度下，盐会屏蔽过量组分的带电壳层，导致颗粒的聚合，且这种聚合可能是不可逆的。对于弱复合物，高盐浓度的加入往往会引起颗粒的溶解，而非聚合。</span>

**Fig. 2** Structure and mechanism of formation of colloidal complexes from a polycation in excess and a default polyanion. Primary complexes are rapidly formed by charge neutralization of PE segments of opposite charge. Their aggregation through hydrophobic interaction results into larger colloidal structures stabilized by the polycation in excess which is only partially complexed with the particle core. Further addition of polycation leads to the progressive shrinkage of the corona and the densification of the core

The process of particle formation is easy to set up because it simply consists of mixing the two aqueous solutions of PEs under stirring. However, attention must be paid to the choice of mixing conditions in the case of strong complexes forming frozen structures like those based on nucleic acids. For these systems, the particle size is strongly dependent on the mixing time, i.e., the time required to homogenize components, with fast mixing conditions systematically leading to smaller particle sizes due to a better homogenization of PEs prior to complexation. This is similar to a precipitation process through nucleation and growth where fast mixing rates result in nucleation being favored over growth and hence smaller particle size. Therefore, all parameters influencing the mixing time like the PE concentration, the rate of addition, the stirring speed, and even the size and shape of the reactor must be carefully considered. In general, fast mixing conditions not only result in smaller but also more stable complex particles. Another important parameter related to the formation of strong complexes is the order of addition. Indeed, it is advisable to always add the PE in default to the one in excess in order to avoid the system to reach, even transiently, the charge neutrality (*Z* = 1) where irreversible aggregation may occur. For PEs forming strong complexes, the use of microfluidic tools is then particularly relevant for controlling the mixing time and neglecting the order of addition. For PEs forming weak complexes, the mixing conditions should be less relevant since the complexes are formed at equilibrium.

<span style=color:blue>颗粒的形成过程相对简单，只需将两种聚电解质（PE）水溶液在搅拌条件下混合即可。然而，对于形成冷冻结构的强复合物（例如基于核酸的体系），需特别注意混合条件的选择。这类体系中，颗粒尺寸显著受混合时间的影响，即完成组分均匀化所需的时间。快速混合条件通常会生成更小的颗粒尺寸，因为在复合化之前，PE的均匀分布更加充分。这一过程与通过成核与生长的沉淀过程相似，较快的混合速率有助于成核优于生长，从而形成更小的颗粒。因此，所有可能影响混合时间的因素（例如PE的浓度、加入速率、搅拌速度，甚至反应器的尺寸和形状）都需仔细优化。通常，快速混合条件不仅能生成较小的颗粒，还能提高复合颗粒的稳定性。另一个与强复合物形成密切相关的因素是加入顺序。建议将不足的PE缓慢加入到过量的PE溶液中，以避免系统即便是短暂地达到电荷中和状态（*Z* = 1），从而引发不可逆的聚集现象。对于形成强复合物的PE，微流控技术尤其具有应用优势，它能够精确控制混合时间，同时使加入顺序对复合形成的影响可以忽略不计。而对于弱复合物，由于其在平衡态下自然形成，混合条件的选择则不那么关键。</span>

In general, the formation of electrostatically stabilized particles of complex requires a significant excess of one of the two PEs since complexes tend to aggregate over time at *Z* close to 1. It is thus advisable to work at *Z* < 0.7 (excess of negative charges) or *Z* > 1.5 (excess of positive charges) to obtain stable suspensions of complexes. For *Z* values far away from the unity, the dispersions contain unreacted PE chains coexisting with complex particles. The amount of free PE is difficult to predict but it can be experimentally determined by gel electrophoresis or by titration of the supernatant after centrifugation of the dispersions. The centrifugation is also a convenient technique to remove the excess of PE. It is noteworthy that complexes of nucleic acids are typically formed at N:P ratios above 10 and used without removal of excess polycation. In fact, the excess of free polycation can destabilize the cell membrane, thus favoring the cell internalization of particles.

<span style=color:blue>形成静电稳定的复合颗粒通常需要一方聚电解质（PE）显著过量，因为当*Z*接近1时，复合物易随时间发生聚集。为获得稳定的复合物悬浮液，建议操作条件为*Z* < 0.7（负电荷过量）或*Z* > 1.5（正电荷过量）。在*Z*值远离1的情况下，分散体系中通常会存在未反应的PE链，与复合颗粒共存。尽管自由PE的具体量难以准确预测，但可以通过凝胶电泳或对离心后上清液进行滴定实验来确定。此外，离心也是去除过量PE的有效方法。需要特别注意的是，核酸复合物通常在N:P比高于10的条件下形成，并在未去除过量聚阳离子的情况下直接使用。事实上，过量的自由聚阳离子能够使细胞膜发生不稳定性，从而促进颗粒的细胞内吞过程。</span>

## 3 Chitosan 壳聚糖

### 3.1 Origin of Chitosan 壳聚糖的来源

Chitosan is obtained from the partial *N*-deacetylation of chitin under alkaline conditions. If chitin was first isolated from mushrooms (Braconnot, 1811), it is nowadays mainly produced from various marine seashell wastes and thus available in large amounts in the fishery industry. Chitin and chitosan from fungal origin are also commercially available under the trade name Kitozyme. Chitin and chitosan have the same chemical structure as they are linear copolymers composed of d-glucosamine and *N*-acetyl-d-glucosamine linked by β-(1→4) glycosidic bonds (Fig. 3). Their solubility properties allow to differentiate them: chitosan is soluble in slightly acid aqueous solutions like 1% acetic acid through the protonation of primary amines whereas chitin is insoluble in water, except for very low degrees of polymerization (DP < 6). Chitosan is therefore obtained when the degree of acetylation (DA), i.e., the molar fraction of acetylated units is sufficiently low so that enough glucosamine units can be protonated to solubilize the polymer chain. This condition is typically achieved when the DA is lower than 60–70% depending on the molar mass and the origin of chitosan.

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖是通过几丁质在碱性条件下的部分*N*-去乙酰化制备而成。尽管几丁质最早由蘑菇中提取（Braconnot, 1811），但当前主要通过加工各种海洋贝壳废料制备，在渔业工业中供应充足。此外，以真菌为原料的几丁质和壳聚糖也已商品化，并以“Kitozyme”为商品名进行销售。几丁质和壳聚糖的化学结构一致，均为由d-氨基葡萄糖与*N*-乙酰-d-氨基葡萄糖通过β-(1→4)糖苷键连接而成的线性共聚物（图3）。它们的溶解性差异是区分两者的关键特性：壳聚糖通过初级胺基团的质子化能够溶解于略酸性水溶液（如1%乙酸），而几丁质在水中不溶，除非聚合度极低（DP < 6）。因此，壳聚糖的制备依赖于乙酰化度（DA，即乙酰化单元的摩尔分数）是否足够低，以使得足量的氨基葡萄糖单元质子化，进而溶解聚合物链。根据壳聚糖的来源及摩尔质量，这一条件通常在乙酰化度低于60%至70%时可以实现。</span>

**Fig. 3** Chemical structure of chitosan. DA refers to the degree of acetylation

Controlling the DA and the molar mass is essential with regard to the physicochemical and biological properties of chitosan. The control of the DA is achieved either by heterogeneous deacetylation of chitin with concentrated sodium hydroxide solutions at high temperatures or by homogeneous reacetylation of a highly deacetylated chitosan with acetic anhydride under mild conditions in hydro-alcoholic mixtures. The deacetylation approach tends to favor an irregular structure with a block distribution of acetylated units due to the semi-crystalline nature of the initial chitin which decreases the accessibility of the sodium hydroxide to reactive sites. Conversely, the acetylation method gives a random distribution of the acetylated units along the chain. It is important to know the origin of the chitosan used because the pattern of the acetylated groups can strongly influence the solution properties of chitosan and also the biological activity. For example, a chitosan with DA = 50% can be only partially soluble in acid solutions when heterogeneously deacetylated whereas it is soluble in neutral aqueous medium when homogeneously acetylated at the same DA. Most commercial chitosans have a DA around 20% and are obtained by heterogeneous deacetylation; therefore, the presence of irregularities in the acetylation pattern cannot be excluded. The control of molar mass is achieved through hydrolysis of the polymer chain by chemical or enzymatic approaches or by means of an ultrasound treatment. The polymer degradation can be monitored by size exclusion chromatography or viscometry. These different approaches allow to prepare chitosan oligosaccharides with a good control of the degree of polymerization.

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖的物理化学和生物学特性在很大程度上依赖于乙酰化度（DA）和摩尔质量的精确控制。DA的控制可通过两种主要方法实现：一种是通过异相去乙酰化工艺，即在高温下利用浓氢氧化钠溶液处理几丁质；另一种是通过均相重新乙酰化工艺，即在温和条件下，使用乙酸酐在水-醇混合溶液中处理高度去乙酰化的壳聚糖。由于几丁质的半晶体结构降低了氢氧化钠对反应位点的可达性，去乙酰化工艺通常会导致乙酰化单元呈现块状分布的不规则结构。相比之下，乙酰化工艺则能形成乙酰化单元沿链随机分布的结构模式。了解壳聚糖的来源十分重要，因为乙酰化基团的分布模式会显著影响其溶液特性和生物活性。例如，对于乙酰化度为50%的壳聚糖，若通过异相去乙酰化制备，则可能仅在酸性溶液中部分溶解；而通过均相乙酰化制备的壳聚糖在相同DA下则可溶于中性水溶液。市售壳聚糖的乙酰化度通常约为20%，大多通过异相去乙酰化工艺制备，因此无法完全排除乙酰化模式中的不规则性。摩尔质量的控制则依赖于聚合物链的水解，可采用化学或酶促方法，或通过超声波处理实现。降解过程通常通过尺寸排阻色谱法或粘度法进行监测。这些方法可实现壳聚糖寡糖聚合度的良好控制。</span>

### 3.2 Biological Properties 生物学性质

Chitosan is known for its high biocompatibility, biodegradability, bioadhesivity (thanks to the presence of protonated glucosamine residues), as well as anti-tumor activity. This makes chitosan suitable for use in several applications in medicine. Biological properties of chitosan and chitosan oligosaccharides have been reviewed in several articles. One of the mains advantages of chitosan is its low cationicity at physiological pH (see below) in comparison to polycations like polyethylene imine or polylysine. This unique property is associated to a low toxicity of chitosan both in oral and intravenous routes and a limited activation of the complement system. The low cationicity is also at the origin of a high buffering capacity that promotes the proton sponge effect in the endosomal compartments, which is relevant in the context of siRNA delivery.

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖以其卓越的生物相容性、生物降解性、生物黏附性（归因于质子化葡萄糖胺残基的存在）以及显著的抗肿瘤活性而广受关注，这些特性使其在医学领域具有广泛的应用潜力。关于壳聚糖及壳聚糖寡糖的生物学特性，目前已有多篇文献综述对此进行了深入探讨。壳聚糖的一大优势在于其在生理pH条件下的低阳离子性（详见下文），这一特性显著区别于聚乙烯亚胺或聚赖氨酸等高阳离子性聚合物。低阳离子性不仅赋予壳聚糖较低的口服和静脉注射毒性，还降低了其对补体系统的激活作用。此外，这一特性还赋予壳聚糖较高的缓冲能力，从而促进内体腔中的质子海绵效应，在siRNA递送体系中具有重要的功能意义。</span>

### 3.3 Solution Properties 溶解性

The solubility of chitosan is an important parameter to consider in the complexation with siRNAs because the polyelectrolyte chains need to be well solvated to perform the ion pairing in best conditions. It is generally stated that chitosan is a weak polybase with an intrinsic pK<sub>0</sub> of 6.5 and is therefore soluble in slightly acidic solutions. This unusually low pK<sub>0</sub> value for a polyamine is at the origin of the low cationicity of chitosan. For comparison, PEI has pK<sub>a</sub> values between 8 and 10 depending on its molar mass and structure. However, the solution behavior of chitosan is more subtle as shown by the increase of the pK<sub>0</sub> from 6.46 for DA 5% to 7.14 for DA 89% which illustrates an increase of the cationicity of amine groups in a more hydrophobic environment, as observed for simple aliphatic amines with the pK<sub>a</sub> increasing with the length of the alkyl chains. As a consequence, the critical pH at which chitosan begins to precipitate increases from 6.2 for DA = 1% to 7.5 for DA = 50% (Fig. 4a). Meanwhile, the fraction of protonated glucosamine residues determined at critical pH decreases with DA thus evidencing that a lower degree of protonation is required to solubilize chitosans with higher DAs (Fig. 4b). For 50% < DA < 70% the chitosan appears to be soluble at any pHs but the solutions then correspond more to a dispersion of highly solvated microgels instead of isolated polymer chains. The chitosan microstructure has also an influence on solution properties as a random distribution of acetyl groups along the polymer chain improves the solubility compared to a block distribution. Other parameters affecting the chitosan solubility are the molar mass, the polymer concentration, the nature of the acid used for protonation, the concentration and nature of the salt added in solution (if any). Regarding the chain conformation, the chitosan behaves at acidic pHs as a semi-flexible polyelectrolyte with a persistence length varying from about 5 nm to 10 nm when the DA increases. Another important aspect of the solution behavior of chitosan is its propensity to form aggregates in aqueous media. Even if they represent only a small fraction of the total material, the aggregates can strongly interfere with light scattering which is a common technique used to characterize polyelectrolyte complexes (Fig. 5). The aggregation is predominant for chitosan of high DA and/or molar mass but aggregates have been also found in solution of chitooligosaccharides or fully deacetylated chitosans. Hydrogen bonds at low DAs and hydrophobic interaction at higher DAs are thought to be responsible of the aggregation of chitosan chains even though the exact mechanism of aggregation is not yet well understood. The aggregates can be removed to a certain extent by membrane filtration with varying efficiency depending on the material and porosity of the filter.

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖的溶解性是其与siRNA形成复合物时需要关注的关键参数，因为聚电解质链只有在充分溶解的情况下才能实现最佳的离子配对。壳聚糖被定义为一种弱碱性聚合物，其固有pK<sub>0</sub>约为6.5，因此可溶于微酸性溶液。这种相对较低的pK<sub>0</sub>值在聚胺类化合物中较为罕见，也是壳聚糖低阳离子性的主要原因。相比之下，聚乙烯亚胺（PEI）的pK<sub>a</sub>值随其分子结构和摩尔质量的不同而介于8至10之间。然而，壳聚糖的溶液行为比这一简单描述更为复杂。研究显示，随着脱乙酰度（DA）从5%增加到89%，pK<sub>0</sub>从6.46升高到7.14，表明随着疏水环境的增强，胺基的阳离子性有所增加，这种趋势类似于脂肪胺，其pK<sub>a</sub>随烷基链长度增加而升高。因此，壳聚糖的临界沉淀pH值从DA = 1%时的6.2增加到DA = 50%时的7.5（图4a）。与此同时，临界pH条件下质子化的葡萄糖胺残基比例随DA升高而下降，表明较高脱乙酰度的壳聚糖所需的质子化程度更低即可溶解（图4b）。对于脱乙酰度在50%至70%范围内的壳聚糖，其在不同pH条件下均表现为可溶性，但其溶液形式更倾向于高度溶胀的微凝胶分散体，而非单一聚合物链。此外，壳聚糖的微观结构对其溶液性质也有重要影响，与块状分布相比，乙酰基沿链随机分布的壳聚糖通常具有更好的溶解性。其他影响壳聚糖溶解性的因素包括分子量、聚合物浓度、质子化用酸的类型、溶液中盐的种类及浓度等。在酸性pH条件下，壳聚糖表现为一种半柔性聚电解质，其持续长度随着DA从约5 nm增至10 nm。壳聚糖溶液的另一个关键特性是其在水相介质中形成聚集体的倾向。尽管这些聚集体仅占总体的一小部分，但它们可能显著干扰光散射技术，这是一种常用于表征聚电解质复合物的实验手段（图5）。高脱乙酰度和/或高分子量的壳聚糖更易形成聚集体，但这种现象在壳寡糖和完全脱乙酰化的壳聚糖溶液中同样存在。低脱乙酰度时的氢键作用和高脱乙酰度时的疏水相互作用被认为是导致壳聚糖链聚集的主要原因，但其确切机制尚未完全明晰。这些聚集体在一定程度上可通过膜过滤去除，具体效率取决于滤膜的材料和孔径大小。</span>

The solution properties of chitosan can be summarized through a general law of behavior obtained through potentiometry, light scattering, interferometry, and viscometry which highlights three distinct domains of DAs (Fig. 6): (i) for DAs ≤ 28% which corresponds to the domain where the ionic condensation takes place according to Manning, the chitosan behaves as a hydrophilic polyelectrolyte whose charge density increases by decreasing the DA. In this domain, the conformation and properties of chitosan are almost fully determined by the intra- and intermolecular electrostatic interaction which can be screened by addition of salt. (ii) for 28% < DA < 50%, hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions are balanced, the physicochemical behavior of chitosan is not strongly influenced by the DA; (iii) For DAs > 50% the prominence of hydrophobic interactions results in a higher cationicity which is of interest for applications at neutral pH but the self-association of chains also increases in the same way.

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖的溶液性质可通过一项基于电位滴定、光散射、干涉测量以及粘度测量的研究总结为一般规律，该规律划分了三个显著的脱乙酰度（DA）区间（图6）：**(i) DA ≤ 28%：静电主导的亲水性区域**，在此范围内，根据Manning理论，壳聚糖发生离子凝聚并表现为一种高亲水性聚电解质，其电荷密度随DA的降低而增加。在这一区域，壳聚糖的分子构象及溶液性质几乎完全由分子内和分子间的静电相互作用所决定，这些静电相互作用可以通过加入盐来有效屏蔽；**(ii) 28% < DA < 50%：亲水性与疏水性平衡区域**，在这一范围内，壳聚糖的亲水性和疏水性相互作用处于平衡状态，其物理化学性质对DA的变化并不敏感。壳聚糖在此区间内表现出相对稳定的溶液行为，因此在不同条件下的应用中具有较好的适应性；**（iii）DA > 50%：疏水主导的阳离子增强区域**
当DA超过50%时，疏水性相互作用占据主导地位，导致壳聚糖表现出更高的阳离子性，这在中性pH环境下的潜在应用中尤为重要。然而，与此相伴的是壳聚糖链的自组装趋势显著增强，可能对其溶液稳定性和加工性能产生一定影响。</span>

### 3.4 Complexation Behavior of Chitosan 壳聚糖的复合机制

The electrostatic complexation of chitosan with polyanions of synthetic or natural origin has been the topic of numerous research works related to fundamental aspects and applications. Chitosan can form either strong (solid) or weak (liquid) complexes depending on the nature of polyanion and the conditions of complexation. An illustrative example is the chitosan-hyaluronan system which is able to form both types of complexes depending on the pH and the charge ratio, thus highlighting the existence of a continuum of morphologies. In the case of nucleic acids, chitosan form strong complexes with DNA, RNA, and homopolynucleotides in standard conditions of complexation as shown by the formation of solid precipitates. The negative enthalpy of complexation of the chitosan with DNA is also in agreement with complexes forming strong interaction. Therefore, the formation of chitosan-nucleic acid complexes must be dependent on initial conditions such as the mixing time.

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖与合成或天然来源的聚阴离子之间的静电复合已成为众多研究的热点，涵盖了基础理论和实际应用。根据聚阴离子的种类和复合反应条件，壳聚糖可以形成强（固体型）或弱（液体型）复合物。一个典型的例子是壳聚糖-透明质酸系统，该系统能够根据pH值和电荷比的不同，形成两种类型的复合物，从而揭示了复合物形态的连续性。对于核酸，壳聚糖在标准复合条件下能够与DNA、RNA以及同聚核苷酸形成强复合物，这些复合物通常表现为固体沉淀物。壳聚糖与DNA复合物的负焓变化也与强相互作用的复合物相一致。因此，壳聚糖与核酸的复合反应受初始条件的影响，特别是混合时间等因素，均可能对复合物的形成过程产生重要影响。</span>

Chitosan-based colloidal complexes are obtained according to the complexation mechanism depicted in Fig. 2. Some general trends related to the complex sizes can be deduced from a systematic study performed on the chitosan-dextran sulfate system used for vaccine delivery. Dextran sulfate (DS) is a polyanion containing 2.2 sulfate functions per saccharidic residue. First, an increase of the molar mass of chitosan from 15 kDa to 350 kDa systematically leads to larger particle sizes when the chitosan is in excess ([+]/[−] > 1) (Fig. 7a). This behavior illustrates the presence of a rigid shell of chitosan around particles whose thickness directly depends on the chitosan chain size. In comparison, the molar mass of DS has a minor influence on particle size, even when added in excess ([+]/[−] < 1), because it is a much less rigid polymer than chitosan. By increasing the DA, the particle size increases due to the mismatch in charge density between polycationic chitosan and polyanionic dextran sulfate; more chitosan molecules are needed within complexes to achieve the ion pairing (Fig. 7b). It is noteworthy that particles always become smaller and probably denser when the charge ratio approaches the unit, before the precipitation occurs, as a consequence of the densification of the core particle and the shrinking of the outer shell. Such a trend has been observed in many PE systems. When *Z* = 1, the complex particles always precipitate as a consequence of the full charge neutralization. The increase of the ionic strength by addition of a salt favors the conformational adaptation of PE chains in complexes leading to smaller particles with a denser core (Fig. 7c) and the contraction of the chitosan shell. No flocculation of the complexes was observed at moderate salt concentrations ([NaCl] < 0.15 M).

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖基胶体复合物的形成遵循图2所示的复合机制。通过对壳聚糖-葡聚糖硫酸盐系统（用于疫苗递送）的系统研究，已能总结出与复合物粒径相关的一些一般规律。葡聚糖硫酸盐（DS）作为一种聚阴离子，每个糖残基上含有2.2个硫酸基团。研究发现，当壳聚糖的分子量从15 kDa增加到350 kDa时，在壳聚糖过量的条件下（[+]/[−] > 1），复合物的粒径呈系统性增大（见图7a）。这一现象表明，复合物周围存在由壳聚糖构成的刚性外壳，其厚度直接取决于壳聚糖链的长度。相比之下，葡聚糖硫酸盐的分子量对粒径的影响较小，即使其在过量的条件下（[+]/[−] < 1）添加，因为其比壳聚糖的刚性要弱得多。随着去乙酰化度（DA）的增加，复合物的粒径也会增大，这主要是由于壳聚糖的多阳离子和葡聚糖硫酸盐的多阴离子之间电荷密度的不匹配；为实现电荷配对，复合物中需要更多的壳聚糖分子（见图7b）。值得注意的是，当电荷比接近1时，复合物粒径通常变小且可能变得更加密集，这一趋势在沉淀发生之前尤为显著，这表明复合物核心的密实和外壳的收缩。该趋势在许多聚电解质系统中均有观察到。当*Z* = 1时，由于电荷完全中和，复合物颗粒通常会沉淀。通过添加盐来增加离子强度，有助于聚电解质链在复合物中的构象适应，从而导致颗粒尺寸缩小，核心变得更加密实（见图7c），与此同时，壳聚糖外壳也发生收缩。在中等盐浓度下（[NaCl] < 0.15 M），未观察到复合物发生絮凝。</span>

**Fig. 7** Role of various parameters on the hydrodynamic diameters (*D*<sub>h</sub>) of PE complex particles obtained from chitosan and dextran sulfate at pH 4. (**a**) Influence of the molecular weight (*M*<sub>w</sub>) of PEs (DA chitosan = 15%). (**b**) Influence of the degree of acetylation of chitosan (*M*<sub>w</sub> chitosan = 1.5 10<sup>5</sup> g/mol, *M*<sub>w</sub> dextran sulfate = 1.5 10<sup>6</sup> g/mol). (**c**) Influence of the salt concentration (NaCl) (*M*<sub>w</sub> chitosan = 1.5 10<sup>4</sup> g/mol, DA = 15%, *M*<sub>w</sub> dextran sulfate = 10<sup>4</sup> g/mol). 

The chitosan-dextran sulfate system forms strong complexes as seen by the formation of a precipitate at charge stoichiometry. Then the mixing conditions deserved to be studied in details (mixing order and rate of addition of components). In general, the dropwise addition (or titration method) does not allow to form stable complexes on either side of *Z* = 1 because of the quasi-irreversible aggregation occurring at the charge neutrality. Then, complexes with an excess of positive charges must be prepared by addition of dextran sulfate to chitosan and vice versa for negatively charged complexes. Conversely, the one-shot addition of components allows to reach any *Z* values without observing precipitation, except at *Z* = 1 of course. The complex particles are also smaller compared to those obtained in a dropwise addition (Fig.8) . The PE composition in the complex particles can be accurately determined at any *Z* values through a rather simple depletion method where the suspensions of complexes were centrifuged and the free PEs in the supernatants assayed with specific dyes (Orange II for chitosan and Toluidine blue for dextran sulfate). Significant differences of composition in the complex particles were reported according to the polymer in excess, which could be attributed to various complexation mechanisms in relation with the reactivity and conformation of each polymer.

<span style=color:blue>在壳聚糖-葡聚糖硫酸盐系统中，复合物在电荷比达到计量时会形成强复合物，表现在电荷中和条件下会生成沉淀。因此，搅拌条件（包括混合顺序和组分添加速率）需要详细研究。通常，逐滴添加法（或滴定法）不能在电荷比*Z* = 1的两侧形成稳定的复合物，因为在电荷中和时，聚电解质会发生准不可逆的聚集。因此，带有过量正电荷的复合物应通过将葡聚糖硫酸盐添加到壳聚糖中来制备，带有负电荷的复合物则应通过相反的顺序来制备。与之相对，单次添加法能够在不发生沉淀的情况下实现任何*Z*值，当然，当*Z* = 1时除外。此外，采用单次添加法制备的复合物粒径通常较小，相较于逐滴添加法所得到的复合物（见图8）。无论电荷比如何，复合物粒子中的聚电解质成分都可以通过一种简单的去除法准确测定。具体方法是将复合物悬液离心，并使用特定染料（壳聚糖使用橙色II，葡聚糖硫酸盐使用苯胺蓝）测定上清液中的自由聚电解质。研究发现，复合物粒子的组成会根据过量聚合物的不同而显著变化，这可能与每种聚合物的反应性和构象变化相关，进而影响复合物的形成机制。</span>

A major issue of chitosan-based polyelectrolyte complexes is their poor stability under physiological conditions due to the presence of electrolytes and the pH value at which the degree of protonation of chitosan is low. The effect of electrolytes on PE complexes depends on the type of complex: weak complexes tend to redissolve at a critical salt concentration whereas strong complexes precipitate. Various strategies have been proposed to improve the stability of particles without modifying the chemical structure of chitosan. First, it has been shown that using rather highly acetylated chitosans (DA ~ 50%) considerably improves the long-term storage stability of positively charged complex particles in 150 mM NaCl solution or PBS buffer. This can be explained by considering the two main modes of stabilization of particles according to the DA. In brief, for DAs < 50% the stabilization is predominantly electrostatic and thus the presence of salt may induce the aggregation of particles. For DAs ~ 50%, the charge density is lower but the chain hydration remains high enough to allow steric forces to stabilize the particles. The strong increase of the cationicity of amine groups at DA = 50% must also account for a better stability of the electrostatic linkages at physiological pH. Using DAs higher than 50% is not advisable because of the strong tendency of the polymer chains to self-associate. Another method to achieve the stability in physiological conditions (PBS, 37 °C) is obtained by introduction of multivalent ions like Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the complex dispersion. These ions form coordination bonds with the hydroxyl and amine groups of chitosan and with some functional groups of the polyanion as well. This results in an ionic cross-linking of the PEs chains in the complex which provides better stabilization. Following this approach, zinc-stabilized complexes of chitosan/hyaluronan or chitosan/chondroitin sulfate have been developed for the HIV-1 inhibition. Similarly, complexes of chitosan-ATP (adenosine triphosphate) or chitosan-TPP (tripolyphosphate) can be stabilized in physiological media with Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions that bind strongly to amine groups of chitosan and phosphate groups of ATP.

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖基聚电解质复合物在生理条件下的稳定性较差，主要受到电解质存在及壳聚糖在低质子化度（pH值较低）下的电荷状态影响。电解质对聚电解质复合物的影响取决于复合物的类型：弱复合物在达到临界盐浓度时会重新溶解，而强复合物则会沉淀。为了提高颗粒的稳定性而不改变壳聚糖的化学结构，已有多种策略被提出。研究表明，使用乙酰化度较高的壳聚糖（DA ~ 50%）能够显著提高在150 mM NaCl溶液或PBS缓冲液中带正电荷复合物颗粒的长期储存稳定性。这一现象可通过考虑乙酰化度对颗粒稳定性的两种主要作用机制来解释：对于DA < 50%时，颗粒的稳定性主要由静电作用决定，因此盐的存在可能引发颗粒的聚集；而对于DA ~ 50%的壳聚糖，其电荷密度较低，但链水合作用仍然足够强烈，可以通过空间排斥力来稳定颗粒。此外，DA = 50%时，氨基的阳离子性增强，也有助于在生理pH条件下维持静电相互作用的稳定性。由于聚合物链容易自聚，使用DA > 50%的壳聚糖不太适宜。另一种在生理条件下（PBS，37°C）实现颗粒稳定性的方法是通过引入多价离子（如Zn<sup>2+</sup>）。这些离子通过与壳聚糖的羟基和氨基以及一些聚阴离子的官能团形成配位键，导致聚电解质链的离子交联，从而提高了颗粒的稳定性。基于此策略，已开发出用于HIV-1抑制的锌稳定壳聚糖/透明质酸或壳聚糖/硫酸软骨素复合物。同样，壳聚糖-ATP（腺苷三磷酸）或壳聚糖-TPP（三聚磷酸）复合物也能通过Fe<sup>3+</sup>离子得到稳定，这些离子能够与壳聚糖的氨基及ATP的磷酸基团强烈结合，从而增强颗粒稳定性。</span>

## 4 Chitosan-Based siRNA Delivery Systems 基于壳聚糖的siRNA递送系统

When it comes to the delivery of siRNA, all parameters related to the chitosan structure and the conditions of complexation described in the previous sections need to be consider to optimize the formulation of siRNA complexes. There is some discrepancy among the data reported in literature which can be partly explained by various issues related to the origin of chitosan, the mixing conditions and other experimental factors. Anyway, the large body of data in the literature allows to establish a certain number of trends regarding the complexation thermodynamics, the colloidal characteristics of complexes, their stability in the biological environment, and their ability to disassemble and release siRNA in the cell to perform gene silencing.

<span style=color:blue>在siRNA递送过程中，优化siRNA复合物配方需要综合考虑壳聚糖的结构特性及复合物形成条件。文献中存在一定的差异性，这部分可以归因于壳聚糖的来源、混合条件以及其他实验因素的不同。然而，现有的大量研究数据使我们能够识别出一些关键趋势，包括复合物的热力学性质、胶体特性、在生物环境中的稳定性，以及它们在细胞内的解离行为和释放siRNA的能力，从而实现基因沉默效果。</span>

### 4.1 Thermodynamics of Complexation 复合作用的热力学

The strength of the interaction between chitosan and siRNA can be determined by using the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) technique which provides the enthalpy and entropy changes of the complexation (ΔH and ΔS), the stoichiometry of complexation (n) and the binding constant (K) which is related to change in the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) through the equation: ΔG = ΔH-TΔS = −RT ln K. ITC is therefore a performant technique to evaluate the thermodynamics of complexation under various conditions of pH, ionic strength, molar mass, and DA of chitosan. The determination of the thermodynamic parameters allows to better anticipate the chemical stability of complexes in the presence of serum proteins and their capacity to dissociate within the cell to release siRNA. However, the analysis of thermograms and their interpretation can be complicated by various heat effects related to buffer ionization, solvation, hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonds, most of which are difficult to quantify. The thermograms are usually fitted with a one binding site model but a two binding site model may be necessary to distinguish the contribution of the ionic complexation from the aggregation or condensation steps that may occur, particularly in the vicinity of the charge stoichiometry. For chitosan oligosaccharides, aggregation phenomena have been also evidenced at early stage of the titration.

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖与siRNA之间相互作用的强度可以通过等温滴定量热法（ITC）来评估，该技术能够提供复合物形成的焓变（ΔH）和熵变（ΔS）、复合物化学计量比（n）以及结合常数（K），结合常数与吉布斯自由能变化（ΔG）之间的关系通过下列公式表示：ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = −RT ln K。因此，ITC是一种高效的技术，能够在不同的pH值、离子强度、壳聚糖分子量以及去乙酰化度（DA）条件下详细评估复合物形成的热力学性质。热力学参数的测定有助于预测复合物在血清蛋白存在下的稳定性，并评估其在细胞内解离以释放siRNA的能力。然而，热图的分析与解读可能会受到多种热效应的影响，这些热效应来源于缓冲液的离子化、溶剂化、疏水相互作用及氢键等，而这些效应大多难以量化。热图通常采用单一结合位点模型进行拟合，但在接近电荷化学计量比时，可能需要使用双结合位点模型来区分离子复合化与聚集或凝结过程的贡献。对于壳聚糖寡糖，聚集现象已在滴定的初期阶段被证实。</span>

The enthalpy change associated to the ion pairing between chitosan and siRNA is negative as expected for a polyion pair forming strong complexes. However, it was shown for the chitosan-DNA system that a significant amount of the heat released arises also from the ionization of the buffer (BH<sup>+</sup> → B + H<sup>+</sup>) used as solvent. Indeed, the complexation of chitosan with a strong polyanion like DNA or siRNA leads to an increase of the pK<sub>a</sub> of chitosan because of its reduced electrostatic potential upon complexation, thus causing a proton transfer from the buffer to chitosan. The entropy contribution TΔS is always higher than ΔH in absolute value which confirms that the release of counterions drives the electrostatic complexation. For a fully deacetylated chitosan, the binding constant K increases sharply when the degree of polymerization (DP) of the chitosan varies from 5 to 13, which highlights the cooperativity of the complexation. A similar behavior has been observed for the complexation of chitosan with DNA, where the affinity between the two PEs strongly increases for a chitosan DP between 6 and 9. The complex stoichiometry varies from 5:1 (protonated glucosamine:phosphate) for DP 5 to nearly 1:1 for DP 13, which was confirmed by a chemical assay of the unbound phosphate groups of siRNA in the complex dispersion. In fact, the existence of a critical DP was evidenced in the past years for several polyelectrolyte systems of natural or synthetic origin. A patch of 5–10 consecutive charged units generates a high electrostatic potential which destabilizes the polyelectrolyte chain and thus strongly increases its reactivity for a polyion of opposite charge. Above this threshold in DP, the binding constant continues to increase with the chitosan chain length, mainly for entropy reasons due to the increasing contribution of the hydrophobic interaction between complexed segments when the chitosan chain becomes longer. Only for very high molecular weights (>300 kDa), a decreased of K was reported and attributed to steric restrictions of chitosan chains that hamper their interaction with the polyanion. When the ionization rate of chitosan is increased, either by lowering the pH or by decreasing the DA, K increases too, which is expected for a complexation mechanism dominated by the electrostatics. It was also shown that the siRNA sequence and the nature of the counter ion associated with chitosan can influence the binding affinity, which for the latter can be explained by considering the polyelectrolyte complexation as a kind of substitution reaction of counterions. In general, there is a strong correlation between the binding constant and the encapsulation efficiency of siRNA in complexes. Best efficiencies were found for complexes prepared at high N:P ratios (>5) with chitosans of low DA and relatively high molar masses.

<span style=color:blue>壳聚糖与siRNA之间的离子配对所引发的焓变为负值，这表明形成了强的聚离子复合物，符合预期。然而，针对壳聚糖-DNA体系的研究表明，大部分释放的热量来源于缓冲液的离子化过程（BH<sup>+</sup> → B + H<sup>+</sup>），这表明缓冲液中的质子转移对复合物的形成有显著影响。具体而言，壳聚糖与强多阴离子（如DNA或siRNA）形成复合物时，由于复合反应使得壳聚糖的电势降低，导致其pK<sub>a</sub>值增加，从而引发质子从缓冲液转移至壳聚糖分子。熵的贡献（TΔS）总是大于焓变（ΔH）值，这进一步证实了反离子的释放驱动了复合过程。对于完全脱乙酰化的壳聚糖，当聚合度（DP）从5增加到13时，结合常数K显著增加，突显了复合反应的协同性。类似的现象也在壳聚糖与DNA的复合中得到了观察，当壳聚糖的DP处于6到9之间时，两者之间的亲和力显著增强。复合物的化学计量比从DP 5时的5:1（质子化葡萄糖胺：磷酸盐）到DP 13时接近1:1，这一变化已通过化学分析确定，在复合液中未结合的siRNA磷酸根含量得到验证。事实上，近年来已证实在多个天然或合成聚电解质体系中存在一个临界聚合度（DP），即当连续带电的单位数达到5至10时，聚电解质链的电势急剧增加，这种高电势会使链的稳定性降低，从而增强其与相反电荷聚离子的反应性。超过这一聚合度临界值后，结合常数K会随着壳聚糖链长度的增加而持续增大，这主要归因于随着链长的增加，复合物中疏水相互作用的贡献增大，从而增加了熵。仅当壳聚糖分子量非常高（>300 kDa）时，K才会出现下降，原因是空间位阻效应使得高分子链与多阴离子的相互作用受到限制。此外，当壳聚糖的电离率提高（通过降低pH值或减少DA），K值也会随之增加，这与电静力学主导的复合机制相一致。研究还表明，siRNA序列的差异以及与壳聚糖相结合的反离子类型也能显著影响结合亲和力，反离子的变化可以通过聚电解质复合过程中的离子置换反应来理解。总体而言，结合常数与siRNA在复合物中的包封效率呈显著正相关。在高N:P比（>5）以及低DA和相对较高分子量的壳聚糖制备的复合物中，包封效率达到最佳。</span>

### 4.2 Physicochemical Properties of Colloidal Complexes 胶体复合物的理化性质

#### 4.2.1 Mixing 混合

The thermodynamic study is important for evaluating the intrinsic stability of complexes against various disassembly mechanisms occurring at the molecular level in the presence of proteins and other charged macromolecules. The study of the colloidal properties of complexes is as much important to determine the conditions of stability of particles in biological media. Before looking at the role of different parameters (molar mass, DA, N:P, pH, and others) influencing the size and stability of particles, it is important to pay attention to the mixing conditions used to perform the complexation since chitosan and siRNA form out-of-equilibrium structures under the usual conditions of pH and salt concentration. As stated before, it is recommended to always add the chitosan solution to siRNA for N:P < 1 and vice versa for N:P > 1 even if the mixing step is fast. Such mixing order prevents the system to reach the neutrality where irreversible aggregation may occur. The rate of addition is equally important, as can be seen in Fig. 9, where the hydrodynamic sizes of the complex particles are always smaller for a fast addition (one shot injection with a micropipette) than a slow addition (dropwise addition with a syringe) . Similarly, the light scattered intensity that is highly sensitive to the presence of aggregates (I<sub>scattered</sub> ∝ R<sup>6</sup> in the Rayleigh scattering regime, with R the radius of particles) is systematically lower for a fast addition, regardless of the concentration of siRNA and N:P ratio. This emphasizes that fast mixing conditions favor a good homogenization of components in the complexation medium, thus avoiding local over concentrations which may lead to aggregation phenomena. However, it is worth mentioning that the upscaling of the manufacturing process of such colloidal materials is not realistic by means of conventional mixing methods as those used here. Therefore, the implementation of micromixers or microfluidic devices to formulate polyelectrolyte complexes for gene delivery in a reproducible manner should be considered on an industrial scale (Fig. 10).

<span style=color:blue>热力学研究对于评估复合物在蛋白质和其他带电大分子存在下的固有稳定性，以及在分子层面发生的不同解聚机制具有重要意义。同时，复合物的胶体性质研究也是不可忽视的，它帮助我们确定粒子在生物介质中的稳定性条件。在探讨影响粒子大小和稳定性的参数（如分子质量、DA、N:P比、pH值等）之前，必须关注用于复合化的混合条件，因为在常见的pH和盐浓度条件下，壳聚糖和siRNA往往形成非平衡结构。如前所述，建议在N:P比小于1时，将壳聚糖溶液加入到siRNA中，而在N:P比大于1时，反之操作，尽管混合步骤很迅速。这样的混合顺序有助于避免体系达到中性点，防止不可逆的聚集现象发生。混合速率同样至关重要。如图9所示，快速添加（通过微量移液管一次性注入）时，复合物粒子的水合大小总是比缓慢添加（使用注射器滴加）时要小。此外，光散射强度（其与粒子半径的六次方成正比，I<sub>scattered</sub> ∝ R<sup>6</sup>，在瑞利散射范围内）对聚集体的敏感性较高，快速添加时的散射强度系统性地较低，这与siRNA浓度和N:P比无关。这表明，快速混合有助于复合物组分在复合介质中的良好均匀化，从而避免局部过度浓缩并引发聚集现象。然而，需要指出的是，使用传统混合方法在工业规模上生产此类胶体材料并不现实。因此，考虑在工业化规模上采用微混合器或微流控设备，以可重复的方式制备聚电解质复合物进行基因递送将是一个值得探索的方向（图10）。</span>

#### 4.2.2 Molar Mass and DA 摩尔质量与乙酰化度

Although the complexation reaction is essentially under kinetic control, the molar mass and DA of chitosan should not be neglected. Stable colloidal particles in the 50–200 nm size range nm can be obtained at N:P ≥ 5 with chitosans having low DAs (≤20%) and molar masses between 10 kDa and 150 kDa which corresponds, respectively, to DP of 60 and 930 for a fully deacetylated chitosan (Fig. 11) . Within this range, the chitosan chains are larger than the size of a siRNA duplex which can be assimilated to a 7 nm long rod. According to the host-guest model proposed by Kabanov and Tsuchida, such a difference in size favors a ladder-like complexation of the short siRNA in default along the long chitosan chains in excess. This results in the formation of neutral segments that can segregate and form the particle core, with the excess chitosan, only partially complexed, forming the outer shell (Fig. 2). In fact, this is an ideal situation to prepare small and well-stabilized complexes. Complex particles obtained from chitosans of lower molar masses (<10 kDa) tend to be larger due to the poor stabilization of the short shell-forming chitosan chains. For a molar mass corresponding to the critical DP of complexation (*see* Subheading 4.1), the complexes are not stable, the complexes are not stable at all due to the lack of cohesion between the short complexed segments. For chitosan of large molar mass (>150 kDa), the particle size increases due to the formation of a prominent stabilizing shell. Additionally the loss of conformational entropy of the long and rigid chitosan chains upon complexation prevents their compaction into a small and dense core. Besides, an increase of the chitosan molar mass also contributes to increase the positive charge of the particles (Fig. 11).

<span style=color:blue>尽管复合化反应主要受到动力学控制，但壳聚糖的分子质量和去乙酰化度（DA）仍不容忽视。在N:P ≥ 5的条件下，使用低DA（≤20%）且分子质量在10 kDa至150 kDa之间的壳聚糖，可以获得尺寸在50–200 nm范围内的稳定胶体粒子，这对应于完全去乙酰化壳聚糖的DP分别为60和930（图11）。在此范围内，壳聚糖链的长度大于siRNA双链的尺寸，后者可以看作是一个7 nm长的棒状结构。根据Kabanov和Tsuchida提出的宿主-客体模型，这种尺寸差异有助于短siRNA分子沿过量的长壳聚糖链形成梯状复合物。这一过程导致形成中性段，这些中性段可以分离并形成粒子核心，而未完全复合的多余壳聚糖则形成外壳（图2）。这种情况非常适合制备小型且稳定的复合物。由分子质量较低的壳聚糖（<10 kDa）制得的复合物粒子往往较大，这主要是由于短壳聚糖链在形成外壳时缺乏足够的稳定性。而当壳聚糖的分子质量接近复合化临界DP时（*见*小节4.1），复合物因缺乏短复合段之间的相互作用而不稳定。对于分子质量较大的壳聚糖（>150 kDa），粒子尺寸增大，原因在于形成了显著的稳定外壳。此外，长且刚性的壳聚糖链在复合化过程中失去的构象熵阻碍了其紧凑成小而致密的核心结构。同时，壳聚糖分子质量的增加还导致粒子正电荷的增强（图11）。</span>

**Fig. 11** Nanoparticle size and zeta-potential (ζ) as a function of DDA (degree of deacetylation), the molar mass of chitosan, and N:P ratio at pH 5.5 for two concentrations of NaCl. Nanoparticles were prepared by manual mixing. 

The role of the DA on the colloidal characteristics of complexes has been less studied. Chitosans used for siRNA delivery have typical DA values below 30% to maximize the charge density. Within this range, the DA does not have a tremendous effect on the particle size. However, the DA strongly impacts on the surface charge as shown by the zeta potential values decreasing from +40 mV to +10 mV when the DA increases from 2% to 28% (Fig. 11) .

<span style=color:blue>去乙酰化度（DA）对复合物胶体特性的影响尚未得到充分研究。用于siRNA递送的壳聚糖通常具有低于30%的DA值，以便最大化电荷密度。在这一范围内，DA对粒子尺寸的影响较小。然而，DA对复合物表面电荷的影响则较为显著，正如ζ电位的变化所示：当DA从2%增加至28%时，ζ电位从+40 mV降至+10 mV（图11）。</span>

#### 4.2.3 Concentration and N:P 浓度与NP比

In addition to the molecular characteristics of chitosans, the formulation conditions must be considered as well. The importance of the role of the mixing method has already been discussed. Other factors to consider are the concentration of PEs and the N:P ratio, the pH and ionic strength of the complexation medium. The complexation is usually performed in diluted buffers adjusted to a pH comprised between 4 and 5 in order to maximize the ionization of chitosan. A salt can be added but the total ionic strength needs to be relatively low (<0.1 M) to avoid extensive screening of the electrostatic interaction. The concentration of chitosan and siRNA has a strong influence on the particle size with larger particles being systematically formed when the concentration increases. Ideally, the complexation should be performed in the dilute polymer regime, i.e., below the overlap concentration (c*) of polymer chains to favor as much as possible homogeneous complexation conditions. c* can be determined for conventional polymers by viscometry measurements using the equation, c* = 1/[η] with [η] the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer solution. c* is around 2 g/L for a chitosan of DA = 1% and *M*<sub>w</sub> = 150 kDa. For a thin rod macromolecule like siRNA, c* is given by c* = 1/L<sup>3</sup> with L the contour length and c* expressed in units of number concentration. For a siRNA of 23 bp (*M*<sub>w</sub> ~ 15 kDa), c* is approximately equal to 70 g/L. Although such a high concentration of siRNA has never been reported, significant aggregation can already be seen at a concentration of 3.5 g/L where the complexes are quite big (~300 nm). Working in very dilute conditions (c < < c*) is the best way to avoid local over concentration effects during the mixing step and thus obtain small complex particles. However, the counterpart can be a too low concentration of complexes for the targeted application. If needed, the particle dispersion can then be concentrated by freeze-drying followed by rehydration in a reduced volume of buffer. The addition of various cryoprotective agents or the particle coating with hyaluronic acid can prevent aggregation phenomena during the freeze-drying.

<span style=color:blue>除了壳聚糖的分子特性外，复合物的配方条件同样至关重要。混合方法的影响已经讨论过。其他需要考虑的因素包括聚电解质（PEs）的浓度、N:P比值、复合介质的pH值及其离子强度。复合反应通常在pH值调节至4至5的稀释缓冲液中进行，以最大化壳聚糖的电离。可以加入盐分，但总的离子强度应保持较低水平（<0.1 M），以避免电荷相互作用的过度屏蔽。壳聚糖和siRNA的浓度对粒子尺寸有显著影响，浓度增大时，粒子尺寸通常也会增大。理想情况下，复合反应应在聚合物链重叠浓度（c*）以下的稀释状态下进行，从而尽可能确保均匀的复合条件。c*可以通过粘度计测量来确定，公式为c* = 1/[η]，其中[η]为聚合物溶液的固有粘度。对于DA = 1%且*M*<sub>w</sub> = 150 kDa的壳聚糖，c*约为2 g/L。对于siRNA这样的细长分子，c*通过公式c* = 1/L<sup>3</sup>来确定，其中L为轮廓长度，c*以数目浓度单位表示。对于23 bp的siRNA（\*M*<sub>w</sub> ~ 15 kDa），c*大约为70 g/L。虽然尚未报道如此高浓度的siRNA，但在浓度为3.5 g/L时，已可观察到显著的聚集现象，复合物尺寸达到约300 nm。在极为稀释的条件下（c << c*）进行工作是避免混合过程中的局部过度浓缩效应并获得较小粒子复合物的最佳方法。然而，这可能导致复合物浓度过低，无法满足实际应用需求。如果有需要，可以通过冷冻干燥后在较小体积的缓冲液中重新水化来浓缩复合物分散液。此外，添加不同的抗冻剂或将颗粒涂层为透明质酸有助于防止冷冻干燥过程中的聚集现象。</span>

The N:P ratio is often varied in a relatively large range of values, from N:P = 0.5 to N:P = 50 or even higher. As previously mentioned, the N:P ratio is different from the charge ratio *Z* (±) as it does not consider the degree of ionization of chitosan which depends on the pH and DA. With a pKa of the phosphate groups close to 1.5, the charge density of siRNA is much less dependent on pH. It is interesting to figure out how many chitosan chains coexist with siRNA for a defined N:P value. Considering the degree of polymerization of chitosan (DP<sub>chitosan</sub>) and the number of base pairs in siRNA (bp<sub>siRNA</sub>) the average number of chitosan molecules (n) per siRNA duplex can be estimated as *n* = (2 * bp<sub>siRNA</sub>/DP<sub>chitosan</sub>) * N:P. For a siRNA of 23 bp and a fully deacetylated chitosan of 25 kDa, n= 3 at N:P=10 while n=1.5 at similar N:P for a chitosan of 50 kDa. Thus, depending on the chitosan molar mass, the excess of chitosan may appear less significant when considering the number of chains rather than the N:P ratio. The role of N:P on particle size is not clearly evidenced due to contradictory results in the literature. According to the complexation scheme in Fig. 2 and size variations in the Fig. 7, one should observe a compaction of the chitosan shell while approaching the stoichiometry. Such a behavior has been observed in some cases for N:P values between 5 and 50. However, the extent of the particle compaction depends not only on the molar mass of chitosan but also on the intrinsic stability of the complexes which can vary for a system to another, especially in the vicinity of the charge neutrality. In general, complex particles tend to aggregate for N:P values below 5 and therefore working at higher N:P is recommended. An excess of chitosan contributes to increase the positive charge of the complex as seen by zeta potential measurements and thus allows a better stabilization of the particles (Fig. 11) . It is also known from studies on PEI that a large excess of polycation facilitates the transfection. The amount of free chitosan in the particle dispersion can be determined with analytical separation techniques like the asymmetrical flow field-flow-fractionation (A4F) or by using depletion method where the particles are centrifuged and the unbound chitosan in the supernatant assayed by UV-vis spectroscopy at 260 nm or 484 nm in the presence of the Orange II dye.

<span style=color:blue>N:P比值在文献中常常变化较大，从N:P = 0.5到N:P = 50甚至更高。如前所述，N:P比值不同于电荷比*Z*（±），因为它并未考虑壳聚糖的电离程度，而电离程度则取决于pH和DA。由于磷酸基团的pKa接近1.5，siRNA的电荷密度对pH的依赖性相对较小。探讨在特定的N:P比值下，壳聚糖链与siRNA的共存情况具有重要意义。考虑到壳聚糖的聚合度（DP<sub>chitosan</sub>）和siRNA的碱基对数（bp<sub>siRNA</sub>），可以通过公式*n* = (2 * bp<sub>siRNA</sub>/DP<sub>chitosan</sub>) * N:P来估算每个siRNA双链所需的壳聚糖分子数量。例如，对于23 bp的siRNA和25 kDa的完全去乙酰化壳聚糖，在N:P=10时，n=3，而对于50 kDa的壳聚糖，在相同的N:P比值下，n=1.5。因此，根据壳聚糖的分子量，考虑到壳聚糖链的数量而非N:P比值，过量的壳聚糖显得不那么显著。关于N:P比值对粒子尺寸的影响，文献中存在矛盾的结果，尚未得出明确结论。根据图2中的复合反应示意图和图7中的粒子尺寸变化，理论上应该观察到在接近化学计量时，壳聚糖壳层的压缩效应。确实，在一些研究中，N:P比值在5到50之间时，观察到了这种压缩现象。然而，粒子压缩的程度不仅取决于壳聚糖的分子量，还受复合物内在稳定性的影响，这一点在不同体系中可能会有所不同，尤其是在电荷中和附近。一般来说，复合物粒子在N:P比值低于5时容易聚集，因此推荐在较高的N:P比值下进行实验。壳聚糖的过量有助于增加复合物的正电荷，这在ζ电位测量中得到体现，从而有助于粒子的稳定（见图11）。根据PEI的研究，过量的多阳离子有助于提高转染效率。游离壳聚糖的含量可以通过如不对称流场流分馏（A4F）等分析分离技术来测定，或使用消耗法，通过离心分离颗粒，再通过紫外-可见光谱法（260 nm或484 nm波长）与橙色II染料一起测定上清液中的未结合壳聚糖。</span>

The morphology of complex particles is generally spherical (Fig. 12) but elongated and less regular shapes have been also reported. The size dispersity of the complexes can be evaluated by means of the so-called polydispersity index (PDI) determined by dynamic light scattering using the cumulant algorithm to analyze the correlation functions. PDI values obtained for chitosan-siRNA complexes are typically comprised between 0.1 and 0.3 which emphasizes a rather large dispersity. In fact, polyelectrolyte complexes are not thermodynamic aggregates like micelles whose size is strictly given by the dimensions of the amphiphilic molecules . Rather, polyelectrolyte complexes form a continuum of structures ranging from loosely aggregated structures to fairly large aggregates (Fig. 12).

<span style=color:blue>复合物粒子通常呈球形（见图12），但也有研究报道其呈拉长且不规则的形状。复合物的尺寸分布可以通过多分散指数（PDI）来评估，该指数通过动态光散射法结合累积算法分析相关函数来计算。对于壳聚糖-siRNA复合物，通常获得的PDI值在0.1至0.3之间，表明这些复合物的分散性较大。事实上，聚电解质复合物并非像胶束那样的热力学聚集体，胶束的大小严格由两性分子决定。相反，聚电解质复合物形成一个连续的结构体系，范围从松散的聚集体到较大的聚集体（见图12）。</span>

#### 4.2.4 Colloidal and Thermodynamic Stability 胶体与热力学稳定性

When it comes to the stability of complexes, a distinction must be made between the colloidal stability related solely to the particle behavior and the thermodynamic stability related to the binding affinity of chitosan with siRNA. The two types of stability can be determined by studying the behavior of complexes under various conditions of pH, ionic strength and concentrations of various polyanions. The colloidal stability of positively charged complexes against salt is reasonably good as seen from the limited aggregation observed in the presence of 150 mM NaCl which corresponds to the ionic strength in physiological conditions (Fig. 11). Conversely, the colloidal stability of similar complexes at physiological pH is very low due to the poor solubility of chitosan in general at pHs above 7 (Fig. 4). The thermodynamic stability of the complex is also impacted at neutral pH as evidenced by gel retardation assays performed at pH 8 where the rapid dissociation of the complex and the concomitant release of siRNA molecules was clearly observed (Fig. 13). This highlights a dramatic weakening of the interaction between components which results from the decreasing charge density and the aggregation of chitosan molecules. In fact, this is the main limitation of using chitosan for siRNA delivery. Conversely, at pH 6.5, the integrity of the complexes is effective for at least 20 h at N:P ratios of 2 or more (Fig. 13), which was further confirmed by the resistance of siRNA against nuclease degradation at same pH. Competition assays with heparin or proteins (BSA, FBS) are also typically performed to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of complexes since large polyanionic molecules can compete with siRNA for binding to chitosan. It is worth mentioning that these assays are relevant when performed at pH values where the complexes are in stable conditions. Competition assays performed in buffer like PBS at pH 7.2 can be biased by the precipitation of chitosan which leads either to the premature release of siRNA or on the contrary to its entrapment in the precipitate, especially at high N:P where there is a large excess of chitosan. That being said, best stability performances of complexes against heparin and serum are generally achieved with chitosans of high molar mass, low DA and with complexes prepared at high N:P, that is, all conditions favoring the strongest binding of siRNA to chitosan according to the thermodynamic study.

<span style=color:blue>在讨论复合物稳定性时，必须区分两种类型的稳定性：与粒子行为相关的胶体稳定性和与壳聚糖与siRNA结合亲和力相关的热力学稳定性。通过研究复合物在不同pH值、离子强度和多种多阴离子浓度下的行为，可以评估这两种稳定性。正电荷复合物在盐的作用下具有较好的胶体稳定性，在150 mM NaCl的溶液中，仅观察到有限的聚集现象，表明其与生理条件下的离子强度相符（见图11）。然而，在生理pH下，类似复合物的胶体稳定性较低，主要由于壳聚糖在pH值大于7时的溶解度差（见图4）。复合物的热力学稳定性在中性pH下同样受到影响，如在pH 8下进行的凝胶延迟实验所示，复合物迅速解离并释放siRNA分子的现象十分明显（见图13）。这一现象突显了组分之间相互作用的显著减弱，源于电荷密度的降低以及壳聚糖分子的聚集。事实上，这也是使用壳聚糖递送siRNA的主要局限性。然而，在pH 6.5条件下，复合物的完整性至少能保持20小时，特别是在N:P比为2或更高的情况下（见图13），这一点也通过在相同pH条件下siRNA对核酸酶降解的耐受性得到进一步确认。通常，使用肝素或蛋白质（如BSA、FBS）进行的竞争实验能够评估复合物的热力学稳定性，因为大分子多阴离子能够与siRNA竞争结合壳聚糖。值得注意的是，这些实验在复合物处于稳定状态的pH条件下进行时更具意义。在PBS缓冲液中，pH为7.2的竞争实验可能会因为壳聚糖沉淀而出现偏差，进而导致siRNA的提前释放或将其困于沉淀中，尤其是在N:P比高的情况下，壳聚糖的过量较大。综上所述，通常在高分子量、低DA的壳聚糖和高N:P比条件下制备的复合物，在肝素和血清中的稳定性表现最佳，这些条件有利于实现siRNA与壳聚糖之间最强的结合。</span>

#### 4.2.5 Biological Evaluation 生物学评价

Since the molar mass, DA and N:P ratios affect the size, charge and stability of particles, these parameters must indirectly impact on the transfection efficiency and gene silencing. Some contradictory results have been reported in the literature, possibly due to variation in the conditions of complexation and transfection protocols. In a recent comprehensive study, all relevant parameters linked to the formulation of chitosan-siRNA complexes, as discussed above, have been investigated in a systematic manner. Authors showed enhanced nanoparticle uptake and gene silencing by increasing the surface charge of complexes, which is primarily obtained at low DA (Fig. 11), as previously shown. This can be understood by considering that highly positively charged particles have better interaction with cell membranes and higher endosomal buffer capacity. The molar mass and N:P ratio have a positive but marginal role on knockdown efficiency. A minimal molar of chitosan of 10 kDa is required for particle stability in the presence of serum, particle internalization and knockdown. This is in contrast to plasmid DNA complexation where a balance between the molar mass and the DA of chitosan must be found in order to complex and condense DNA into small particles while allowing their intracellular unpacking at targeted sites. In the case of siRNA, the critical condition for obtaining small and stable complex particles is to use a chitosan with a chain length longer than that of siRNA, which is equivalent to choosing a chitosan molar mass greater than or equal to 10 kDa. Then, the strength of the binding with siRNA can be tuned via the protonation rate of glucosamine units, either by varying the DA or the pH.

<span style=color:blue>分子量、去乙酰度（DA）和N:P比率会显著影响壳聚糖-siRNA复合物颗粒的大小、电荷和稳定性，因此，这些参数间接影响转染效率和基因沉默效果。文献中有一些矛盾的研究结果，可能是由于复合化和转染方案的条件差异。在一项最新的系统性研究中，作者全面探讨了与壳聚糖-siRNA复合物制备相关的各项关键参数。研究结果表明，通过增大复合物表面电荷，可以有效增强纳米颗粒的细胞摄取和基因沉默，这主要是通过使用低DA的壳聚糖来实现（见图11）。这一现象可以通过考虑高正电荷颗粒与细胞膜的较强相互作用以及较高的内吞体缓冲能力来解释。分子量和N:P比率对基因沉默效率的影响是积极的，但作用较小。在血清环境中，保持复合物颗粒稳定性、促进颗粒内吞及实现基因沉默的最低壳聚糖分子量为10 kDa。这与质粒DNA复合化有所不同，在质粒DNA的情况下，必须在壳聚糖的分子量和DA之间找到一个平衡，以实现DNA的有效复合并形成小颗粒，同时保证其能够在靶向位置成功解包。而对于siRNA来说，获得小而稳定的复合物颗粒的关键是使用分子链长于siRNA的壳聚糖，换句话说，选择分子量大于或等于10 kDa的壳聚糖。进一步地，可以通过调整去乙酰度或pH值来调节壳聚糖与siRNA的结合强度。</span>

## 5 Conclusion 结论

Despite its relatively low cationicity, chitosan is primarily studied and used for its capacity to electrostatically interact with oppositely charged substrates like siRNA molecules. The intensity of the interaction primarily depends on the charged density related to the DA but the molar mass of chitosan is also important due to the cooperative nature of the complexation. Small and well-stabilized particles of complex can be formed in a relatively large range of sizes and surface charges. However, one must pay attention to the mixing conditions to ensure a good homogenization of components in the medium since complexes of chitosan and siRNA do not form equilibrium structures, but rather frozen aggregates. The complexation is a simple and safe procedure to achieve high encapsulation of siRNA in nanoparticles. The downside is the limited particle stability in physiological conditions that relates to the insolubility of chitosan itself at neutral pH. Various chemical or physical approaches have been proposed to circumvent the poor stability of complexes at physiological conditions. These include covalent modifications of chitosan like quaternization, PEGylation, glycosylation and also non-covalent reactions as the so-called ionic gelation with tripolyphosphate anion, which is actually a complexation reaction. However, this adds complexity to the system and possible cytotoxic effects. Recent studies have shown that native chitosan with a low degree of acetylation and a reasonably low molar mass can efficiently deliver siRNA in vitro and in vivo with minimal toxicity.

<span style=color:blue>尽管壳聚糖的阳离子性相对较低，但其主要研究和应用聚焦于其与带相反电荷的底物（如siRNA分子）之间的静电相互作用。该相互作用的强度主要取决于壳聚糖去乙酰度（DA）所决定的电荷密度，但壳聚糖的分子量也起着重要作用，尤其是在复合化过程中，由于其具有协同作用。通过复合化可以在相对较宽的范围内形成小而稳定的复合颗粒，且这些颗粒具有多样化的表面电荷。然而，需要特别注意混合条件，以确保在复合介质中组分的良好均匀性，因为壳聚糖与siRNA的复合物并非形成平衡结构，而是形成冷冻的聚集体。复合化作为一种简单且安全的过程，能够高效地将siRNA包封在纳米颗粒中。其局限性在于，在生理条件下，颗粒的稳定性较差，主要由于壳聚糖在中性pH下溶解度较低。为了解决复合物在生理条件下的稳定性问题，已提出多种化学和物理方法。这些方法包括壳聚糖的共价修饰，如季铵化、PEG化、糖基化，以及非共价反应，如与三聚磷酸盐阴离子形成的所谓离子凝胶化，后者实际上是一种复合反应。然而，这些方法往往会增加系统的复杂性，且可能带来细胞毒性。近期的研究表明，具有低去乙酰度和适当低分子量的天然壳聚糖可以高效地在体外和体内递送siRNA，并且具有较低的毒性。</span>
