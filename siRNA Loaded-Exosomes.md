# siRNA Loaded-Exosomes

María Izco and Lydia Alvarez-Erviti

## Abstract

Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles (40–100 nm) of endocytic origin released by numerous cell types that act as natural carriers of mRNA, microRNA, and proteins between cells. We developed a new system that uses intravenous injection of modified exosomes for siRNA delivery into the brain. Here we describe the generation of unmodified and modified exosomes, which specifically target the brain, and the method to load siRNA into the exosomes.

## 1 Introduction

Knockdown of gene expression has clear potential for treatment of many diseases and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific to a chosen target can be designed readily. However, the use of siRNAs requires a vehicle that delivers the gene therapy molecules specifically and safely into the target tissue. This question is especially relevant for the treatment of diseases affecting the central nervous system. However, one of the major challenges facing this approach is the development of a vehicle which allows a safe and effective delivery of the therapeutic agent to the dispersed regions of the brain where knockdown would be required. The brain is a particularly difficult target for drugs of all classes because the blood–brain barrier excludes most drugs larger than 400 Da. The ideal treatment should be minimally invasive, delivered specifically and safely into the brain following peripheral administration, and not be hindered by immune inhibition. None of the approaches using viral vector or liposomes fulfill these requirements. The use of viral vector requires stereotaxic surgery and the delivery is restricted to restricted brain regions. Liposomes activate the immune response, which mediates the rapid clearance of liposomes in subsequent administration reducing significantly the efficacy in long-term treatments. To overcome these problems, we developed a new system that uses intravenous (iv) injection of modified exosomes for nucleic acid delivery into the brain. Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles (40–100 nm) of endocytic origin released by numerous cell types that act as natural carriers of mRNA, microRNA, and proteins between cells. We have designed and generated modified exosomes, which specifically target the brain, by placing a brain targeting peptide (RVG peptide, rabies virus glycoprotein peptide) in the exterior of the exosome and developed them as a novel system to deliver genetic material into the brain after intravenous injection. A schematic representation of the production, harvest, and administration of targeted RVG-exosomes for gene delivery is shown in Fig.1. Using this system to deliver siRNAs we have obtained remarkably effective knockdown expression of a number of targets in mouse brains after tail vein injection.

## 3 Methods

### 3.1 Dendritic Cell Primary Culture

This section details the procedure for dendritic cell isolation . Alternatively, other cell sources including primary cell and cell lines could be used as source of exosomes.

1. Euthanize mice and disinfect using 70% ethanol (*see* **Note** [**1**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_21_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)).
2. Remove femurs and tibias from euthanized mice in a cell culture hood and place the bones in a 10 cm Petri dish (*see* **Note** [**2**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_21_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)).
3. Remove all the rest of muscle and tendons using a scalpel and transfer the clean bones to a new Petri dish.
4. Cut off both ends of the bone using a scissor and flush off the bone marrow in a new Petri dish with dendritic cell medium using a 10 mL syringe and 21G needle for femur or a 25G needle for tibia.
5. Collect the cell suspension in a sterile 50 mL Falcon tube. Centrifuge at 300 × *g* for 10 min and discard the supernatant.
6. Resuspend the pellet with red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (1–2 mL per mouse) and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Add 5 mL of dendritic cell medium per mL of RBC lysis buffer, centrifuge at 300 × *g* for 10 min, and discard the supernatant 
7. Resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of dendritic cell medium, centrifuge at 300 × *g* for 10 min, and discard the supernatant.
8. Resuspend the pellet with dendritic cell medium supplemented with 10 μg/mL murine GM-CSF and adjust the cell concentration to 106 cell/mL. Plate 3 mL of the cell suspension per well in a six-well plates (*see* **Note** [**3**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_21_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)). 
9. On day 4 transfect the dendritic cells. Prepare the transfection mix adding 6 μg of Lamp2b-RVG plasmid DNA, 6 μL of TransIT LT1 transfection reagent and plain DMEM medium up to 600 μL transfection mix per well, incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Remove the medium from the 6-well plates, replace with 3 mL of dendritic cell medium per well, and add 600 μL of transfection mix. After 4 h remove the medium and replace with 3 mL of dendritic cell medium supplemented with 10 μg/mL GM-CSF (*see* **Note** [**4**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_21_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)). 
10. On day 7 remove the medium and replace with 1.5–2 mL of dendritic cell medium per well.

### 3.2 Exosome Isolation

1. Collect the medium from the 6-well plate and centrifuge at 300 × *g* for 10 min. 
2. Transfer the supernatant to a polycarbonate sterile tube and centrifuge at 12,000 × *g* for 30 min. 
3. Transfer the supernatant to a polycarbonate sterile tube and centrifuge at 12,0000 × *g* for 60 min. 
4. Resuspend the exosomes in 0.1 M ammonium acetate with a 27G syringe, use 30–40 μL per mice (*see* **Note** [**5**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_21_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)).

### 3.3 Exosome Characterization and Quantitation

1. Exosome characterization by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA): The NTA analysis provides data about nanoparticle size distribution and concentration. Dilute the exosomes in sterile PBS before measure; prepare an initial 1:100 dilution, if necessary, prepare serial 1:10 dilutions. For analysis collect 30–60 second videos (3–5 replicates per sample). 
2. Exosome characterization by electron microscopy: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), or cryo-electron microscopy could be used to observe exosomes. Electron microscopy provides images to monitor the size, quality, and purity of the exosomes population. Incubate the exosomes with 4% osmium tetraoxide for 30 min at 4 ° C, apply onto a copper grid, and stain with 1% phosphotungstic acid solution (pH 7) for 10 min. 
3. Western blot : Detection of exosome-enriched proteins is used to characterize and confirm exosome identity. It is necessary to confirm the presence of several protein markers, because no specific proteins have been identified to distinguish exosomes from other extracellular vesicles. Commonly used exosomal markers are Alix, Flotillin-1, TSG101, CD9, CD63, CD81, and hsp70. Solubilize the samples and load a minimal amount of 5 μg total protein, separate on Bis-Tris gel and analyze by Western blot.
4. Quantify the protein content by BCA assay. 

### 3.4 siRNA Loading into Exosomes

1. Prepare the electroporation mix (*see* **Note** [**6**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_21_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)). 
2. Electroporate the mix in a 4 mm cuvette with 400 V and 125 mA of capacitance. To prepare larger quantities of siRNA-electroporated exosomes, prepare the electroporation mix and electroporate 400–600 μL at a time. 
3. Isolate the electroporated exosomes transferring the electroporation mix to an ultracentrifugation tube and add PBS to fill the tube, centrifuge at 12,0000 × *g* for 60 min. 
4. Resuspend the exosomes with a 27G syringe in medium for in vitro experiments or in 5% glucose for in vivo experiments. 
5. Electroporation conditions need to be optimized if a different electroporation buffer or electroporator is used. Alternatively, siRNA could be loaded into exosomes by pH gradient modification, sonication, or calcium chloride (*see* **Note** [**7**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_21_Chapter.xhtml#Sec9)). 

### 3.5 Assessment of siRNA Loading into Exosomes

To quantify the efficiency of exosome-mediated siRNA delivery in vitro, use a target cell line. Incubate the cells with the siRNA-loaded exosomes for 48–72 h. As control use the same amount of siRNA (100 nM) delivered using a conventional transfection reagent. Targeted mRNA and protein downregulation should be similar or higher in the cells treated with siRNA-loaded exosomes. mRNA expression levels could be analyzed by RT-PCR and protein levels by Western blot.

## 4 Notes

1. The average amount of exosomes isolated from the primary dendritic cell isolated from 1 mouse is 40–60 μg. Use mice 8–18 weeks old for dendritic cell primary culture . 
2. Bone marrow is the best source of dendritic cells in animal models, and femur and tibias are the best bones to isolate bone marrow. If the cell culture hood is located in the animal facilities place the bones in a sterile 50 mL Falcon tube and continue the procedure in the cell culture facilities. 
3. Murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells can be generated using GM-CSF alone or in conjunction with interleukin-4 (IL-4).
4. The transfection of the dendritic cells with the Lamp2b-RVG plasmid is necessary to obtain brain-targeted exosomes. Use a different targeting peptide to direct exosomes to other organ targets. Alternatively to produce non-targeted exosomes just replace the medium on day 4 with 3 mL medium supplemented with 10 μg/mL GM-CSF. 
5. There are different techniques to isolate exosomes from cell culture medium. Differential ultracentrifugation allows exosomes isolation from large volumes of biological fluids, requires a relatively small set of reagents and consumables, and has good reproducibility. Alternatively, use commercial isolation reagents or kits based on size exclusion chromatography and precipitation. 
6. If a different source of exosomes or a modified siRNA is used, confirm the optimal amount of exosomes necessary to load and deliver the siRNA. The ratio of siRNA-exosomes is fundamental to obtain an optimal loading.
7. Electroporation ensures that loaded exosomes maintain the characteristics and deliver safely and effectively siRNA in vivo. Alternative methods to load siRNA into exosomes have been developed, to avoid unexpected results associated to the loading method characterize exosomes, effectivity, safety and immune response in the initial experiments.
