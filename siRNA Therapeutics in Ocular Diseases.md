## Abstract 摘要

The field of RNAi therapeutics has quickly adapted to the treatment of ocular diseases. Although the eye provides a unique system for the delivery of siRNAs, its complex structure and composition fostered the development of novel strategies for efficient gene silencing in the target compartment. Moreover, anterior and posterior segments differ in their multiple drug barriers and clearance mechanisms. This chapter summarizes the recent achievements in terms of routes of administration, chemical modifications, and delivery systems for siRNAs that specifically apply to eye disorders. Methods employed for siRNA detection/quantitation in ocular tissues are also described, together with safety concerns that need to be addressed to fulfill regulatory requirements of new drug approval. Even though RNAi therapies for ocular diseases have not yet translated into patient care, we document herein the rising number of candidate drugs currently under preclinical or clinical development.

## 1 Introduction 前言

Ever since RNAi was defined as a ubiquitous, naturally occurring cellular process, the potential for siRNAs to move from research to pharmaceuticals led to a transformative era in drug development. Given the propitious conditions of the eye, ophthalmology was the first therapeutic area where the potential of siRNAs was weighted high and at hand. However, while several RNAi-based therapies were approved in the last years, such breakthrough is still awaited in the field of ocular diseases. Unarguably, several basic and technical issues need to be overcome to obtain increased stability, proper delivery, and bioavailability of siRNAs in eye tissues. In this chapter, we review the pathophysiological particularities of the eye in the context of the new advances in molecular design and delivery systems that have been applied to ocular siRNA candidates, alongside matching safety observations.

<span style=color:blue>自RNA干扰（RNAi）被发现是一种广泛存在的天然细胞过程以来，siRNA从基础研究向药物开发的转化为药物研发开启了一个革命性的新时代。眼部独特的生理条件使其成为首个被广泛研究siRNA潜力的治疗领域。然而，尽管近年来已有多种RNAi疗法获得批准，用于治疗眼科疾病的突破性成果尚未出现。为进一步提升siRNA在眼组织中的稳定性、有效递送和生物利用度，仍需解决诸多技术与基础问题。本章聚焦眼部的病理生理特性，探讨最新的分子设计与递送系统的应用进展，这些进展推动了眼科siRNA候选药物的发展，并结合相应的安全性研究进行了综述。</span>

## 2 Ocular Structures and Modalities for siRNA Administration 眼部结构与siRNA递送的方式

The special localization and ready accessibility of the eye make it an attractive organ for the development of RNAi therapeutics. This site allows a local, almost direct delivery of siRNAs, circumventing some of the difficulties encountered with systemic administration. The overall size of the eye and its different anatomical compartments are rather small, thus requiring the administration of relatively low amounts of compounds at lower associated cost. While the remarkable potential of siRNAs for the treatment of ocular diseases has been quickly appreciated, filling the technological gap toward its clinical application remains a challenge.

<span style=color:blue>眼睛因其独特的位置和便捷的可达性，成为RNAi治疗药物开发的理想靶点。通过局部直接递送siRNA，能够规避全身给药中的许多挑战。此外，眼睛整体体积小、解剖分区细微，因此药物用量较少，相关研发成本也随之降低。尽管siRNA在治疗眼病方面的巨大潜力已广泛被认可，但要将这一技术真正应用于临床仍需克服不少技术难题。</span>

The eye functions to transmit external sensory stimuli to the brain: upon reaching the retina, light rays are transformed into images that are transmitted to the visual cortex for reconstitution. This process is made possible owing to the transparency of the ocular structures, which requires the maintenance of a specialized environment. The eye contains a myriad of barriers that offer protection against external aggression and preserve eye integrity by hindering the passage of xenobiotics to its innermost regions. In the end, the complexity of this organ poses several limitations when trying to reach a therapeutic concentration of a given medication in the target compartment. Delivery to a particular ocular tissue may be achieved using one of the following routes of administration: topical (eye drops), punctal and intrascleral, or by different types of injections such as periocular, subconjunctival, subretinal, suprachoroidal, sub-Tenon’s, intravitreal and directly into the anterior chamber. A diagram of the different modes of ocular administration is presented in Fig. 1. The decision as to which represents the most appropriate route depends upon the nature of the drug, target tissue, and disease. The current section focuses on the two most common routes of administration—topical (ophthalmic) and intravitreal—that have been applied to siRNA therapeutics, and describes the different ocular structures that may influence drug biodistribution and ability to reach target compartments, along with the potential benefits and disadvantages of each route.

<span style=color:blue>眼睛的主要功能是将外界光信号传递至大脑：光线经过视网膜转化为图像，再由视觉皮层进行重建。这一过程依赖于眼部结构的透明性，而维持这一特性需要一个高度专业化的内环境。此外，眼睛存在多种屏障，这些屏障不仅能够抵御外界侵袭，还能阻止外源性物质进入眼内深部，从而保护眼部的完整性。然而，眼睛复杂的结构也为药物到达靶组织并维持治疗浓度带来了很大的挑战。针对眼部特定区域的药物递送，可采用多种给药方式，例如滴眼、泪小管和巩膜内递送，或者通过多种注射方式，包括眼周、结膜下、视网膜下、脉络膜上、Tenon囊下、玻璃体内及前房内注射等。图1展示了这些眼部递送方法的模式图。具体选择哪种递送方式，取决于药物特性、靶组织以及所治疗的疾病。本节将重点介绍siRNA治疗中最常用的两种递送方式——局部滴眼和玻璃体内注射，同时分析可能影响药物分布和靶向能力的眼部结构，并探讨每种途径的优势和局限性。</span>

**Fig. 1** Routes of administration for ocular drugs. Ocular medications can be delivered topically by eye drops instillation (**a**) by intraocular injection via the periocular (**b**), suprachoroidal (**c**) and intravitreal routes (**d**), and by mean of controlled release devices (**e**). Absorption of siRNAs mainly occurs via the conjunctival-scleral route (**f**)

### 2.1 Topical Administration 局部给药

Topical administration is by far the preferred route of ocular application as it provides an easy and non-invasive method for the self-administration of eye drops at home. However, the ocular structures raise multiple barriers to the entry of drugs such as siRNAs: hence, compounds administered as drops scarcely reach the back of the eye, and, in consequence, their use is generally limited to the treatment of disorders affecting the anterior segment. The anterior segment comprises the ocular surface followed by the cornea and the anterior chamber (filled with its aqueous humor), along with the iris, the ciliary body, the lens, and the conjunctiva; all together, these structures form the static barriers that prevent the passage of foreign materials. In addition, the action of metabolic and dynamic barriers hampers the entry of a host of compounds. The tear film first offers an important dynamic resistance as it undergoes a regular turnover that shortens the contact time of instilled compounds with the ocular surface. Eye treatments can also be washed out by lacrimation or the blinking reflex induced by the application of a large volume of fluid (30–40 μL for a drop versus a mean of about 6 μL for tear fluid). In addition, up to 80% of an eye drop can be drained through the nasolacrimal duct; as a result, it was estimated that topically instilled drugs remain on the ocular surface no longer than 15–30 s. Consequently, for an siRNA to be internalized, it must efficiently cross the tear film barrier and rapidly reach corneal or conjunctival tissues.

<span style=color:blue>局部给药因其操作简单且无需侵入性手术，是目前眼部治疗的首选方式。患者可以轻松在家通过滴眼液实现自我管理。然而，眼部的解剖结构为药物如siRNA的有效递送设置了重重障碍。滴眼液中的药物通常难以穿透到眼后段，因此局部给药更多地用于治疗眼前段相关的疾病。眼前段主要包括眼表、角膜、前房（充满房水）、虹膜、睫状体、晶状体和结膜，这些组织形成了有效阻止外源物质进入的静态屏障。同时，代谢屏障和动态屏障的存在也进一步限制了药物的有效吸收。例如，泪膜的快速更新会缩短药物与眼表的接触时间；此外，滴眼液可能因流泪或过多液体（滴眼液每滴30–40 μL，而泪液平均容量约为6 μL）引发的眨眼反射而被迅速冲走。据估算，高达80%的滴眼液会经鼻泪管排出，这使得局部药物在眼表的停留时间通常不会超过15–30秒。因此，要使siRNA能够被有效吸收，必须首先高效穿透泪膜屏障，并迅速到达角膜或结膜组织。</span>

The cornea is a complex structure whose function is to transmit incident light, this is made possible by maintaining transparency and controlling fluid diffusion. It is highly innervated with sensory fibers and ranks as one of the most sensitive tissues of the body. To guarantee its transparency, the cornea is not irrigated by blood vessels; if vascularization takes place (also termed as corneal neovascularization), vision becomes drastically compromised. Five distinct layers compose the cornea: an epithelium, the Bowman’s membrane, a thick stroma, the Descemet’s membrane, and an endothelium. The numerous strata of epithelial cells are densely packed and joined by several tight junctions, thus providing an effective barrier against foreign substances. Next to the cornea (at the junction with the sclera), lies the conjunctiva , a tissue composed of the epithelium, with goblet cells and accessory lacrimal glands (glands of Krause) which function to lubricate the eye by producing mucus and tears, respectively. The conjunctiva has prominent sensory innervation and, contrary to the cornea, is highly vascularized with small vessels. Blood and lymphatic vessels provide a dynamic mode of drug clearance that hinders drug penetration. Finally, resident cells of the conjunctiva, such as macrophages, melanocytes, T, and B lymphocytes, participate in immune surveillance against pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLR) expressed on macrophages, dendritic cells, corneal, and retinal epithelium can control ocular innate immune response. Some siRNAs have been shown to activate TLR and stimulate immune response and wound healing. These off-target effects along with strategies to avoid them will be further described in the next sections. Overall, it is estimated that less than 5% of drugs administered as eye drop eventually reach the aqueous humor, and once inside, might be quickly drained via the trabecular meshwork.

<span style=color:blue>角膜是一种复杂的组织，其主要功能是透射入射光，这依赖于角膜的透明性和对液体扩散的精确控制。作为人体最敏感的组织之一，角膜富含感觉神经纤维。为了保持透明性，角膜没有血管分布；一旦发生血管化（如角膜新生血管的形成），视力可能会受到严重影响。角膜由五层结构组成，包括上皮层、Bowman膜、基质层、Descemet膜和内皮层。角膜上皮细胞排列紧密，并通过紧密连接形成了强大的屏障，有效阻止外来物质进入。位于角膜旁的结膜（在与巩膜的交界处）由上皮组织构成，含有杯状细胞和附属泪腺（如Krause腺），分别分泌粘液和泪液以润滑眼睛。结膜与角膜不同，血管分布密集，含有大量的小血管，并具有显著的感觉神经分布。血液和淋巴循环提供了一种动态的药物清除途径，从而限制药物的有效渗透。此外，结膜中的免疫细胞，如巨噬细胞、黑色素细胞、T细胞和B细胞，能够对病原体进行免疫监测。角膜和视网膜上皮细胞、巨噬细胞以及树突状细胞表达的Toll样受体（TLR）能够调控眼部的先天免疫反应。有研究表明，一些siRNA可以激活TLR，进而刺激免疫反应和促进伤口愈合。有关这些非靶向效应及其规避策略将在后续章节中详细讨论。总体来说，据统计，滴眼液中最终能够到达房水的药物不足5%，而一旦进入房水，也可能迅速通过小梁网被排出，从而进一步限制了药物的作用时间和效果。</span>

In regard to absorption pathways, a topically applied compound can enter by either crossing the cornea to reach the aqueous humor or by the conjunctival-scleral route . Absorption can occur via transcellular or paracellular passage (through or between cells, respectively), as well as by a combination of both. The epithelia of the cornea and conjunctiva form highly lipophilic structures that provide greater permeability to lipophilic drugs. Generally, the cornea allows the entry of small lipophilic molecules, while large hydrophilic drugs are predominantly absorbed via the conjunctival pathway. Consistent with these observations, previous studies conducted on naked non-modified siRNA applied as eye drops have shown that their absorption occurs mainly via the paracellular route of the conjunctiva. This route can be appreciated in Fig. 1, at the junction between the conjunctiva and sclera, which may course from the lower part to the back of the eye.

<span style=color:blue>关于药物的吸收途径，局部滴眼的化合物可以通过两种方式被吸收：一是穿过角膜进入房水，二是通过结膜-巩膜途径到达眼部组织。吸收可以通过穿越细胞（穿细胞途径）或经过细胞间隙（旁细胞途径）进行，或者两种方式共同作用。角膜和结膜的上皮层具有高度的脂溶性，因此对脂溶性药物的通透性更高。通常来说，小分子脂溶性药物更容易通过角膜进入，而大分子亲水性药物则主要通过结膜途径吸收。根据此前的研究结果，非修饰的裸siRNA以滴眼液形式应用时，其吸收主要依赖于结膜的旁细胞途径。这一吸收路径可以在图1中看到，即从结膜和巩膜交界处开始，可能从眼睛下部延伸到后部。</span>

In addition to requiring multiple instillations, topical administration generally leads to low drug concentrations in the back of the eye, and alternatives are being sought in order to overcome these most serious limitations.

<span style=color:blue>然而，局部给药通常需要频繁滴药，这导致眼后部的药物浓度较低，限制了其治疗效果。因此，研究人员正在寻找新的替代方法，以克服这些关键的不足。</span>

### 2.2 Intravitreal Administration 璃体内注射

Ever since the introduction of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) therapies, intravitreal (IVT) drug delivery has become the most common procedure for the treatment of retinal diseases . Using this method, therapeutic solutions or suspensions are injected into the vitreous humor through a high-gauge needle. As this procedure bypasses the natural barriers of the eye, it is considered as the most efficient way to deliver compounds to the posterior segment of the eye. Unfortunately, one important route of drug clearance operates through a mechanism of diffusion to the anterior chamber or via the blood retinal barrier, which separates the eye from systemic circulation. Dynamic clearance may also occur through the choroid, a vascular layer localized between the sclera and retina, and that collects the bulk of the ocular blood flow. As for the multidrug resistance ABC transporters localized at the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), they actively expel xenobiotics to the choroid; however, this active efflux process is not a matter of concern when using siRNA therapeutics.

<span style=color:blue>自从抗VEGF疗法问世以来，玻璃体内注射（IVT）已成为治疗视网膜疾病的首选方法。该技术通过细针将药物溶液或悬浮液直接注射到玻璃体腔中，由于能够绕过眼睛的天然屏障，因此被认为是递送药物至眼后段最有效的方式。然而，药物也会通过扩散至前房或通过血视网膜屏障清除，后者将眼部与全身循环隔离。此外，动态清除可能发生在脉络膜中，这是一层位于巩膜与视网膜之间的高度血管化组织，承担大部分眼部血流量的收集功能。虽然视网膜色素上皮细胞上的ABC转运蛋白可将外源物主动排至脉络膜，但对于siRNA药物来说，这种清除机制并不会显著影响疗效。</span>

Besides the need for anesthesia and antisepsis, IVT injections are associated with numerous side effects such as endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and cataracts, among others. For these reasons, alternatives are also being sought to avoid the use of intraocular injections. Despite all of the possible adverse events, most of previous and ongoing studies on the treatment of retinal diseases using siRNA drugs were locked into the use of ITV injections for optimal tissue penetration and cellular uptake.

<span style=color:blue>玻璃体内注射还需要配合麻醉和严格的无菌操作，并可能引发如眼内炎、视网膜脱离和白内障等副作用。正因如此，研究人员正在探索无需眼内注射的替代方案。然而，即使存在上述不良事件，现有的和正在进行的多数siRNA药物治疗视网膜疾病的研究仍然选择玻璃体内注射，因为它能提供最佳的药物渗透性和细胞摄取效率。</span>

## 3 Design of siRNA for Ocular Therapy

As documented for other tissues, the design of effective siRNAs for the treatment of ocular diseases is based on rules that take into account the presence of specific motifs or regions in the sequence, as well as thermodynamic parameters governing their interaction with the RISC machinery and accessibility to the target mRNA. For instance, the first rule proposed by Elbashir et al. state that “Duplexes of 21 nt siRNAs with 2 nt 3′ overhangs were the most efficient triggers of sequence-specific mRNA degradation”. Several authors also emphasized the importance of the thermodynamic properties of siRNAs in producing efficient gene silencing of a specific target mRNA. However, one of the limitations of some of these empirical rules is that they apply only to small-scale datasets and focus on certain specific genes. While these rules proved decisive for the development of effective siRNAs in several species (human, rat, mouse), significant setbacks happened when trying to select the best siRNA candidate drug to be advanced into clinical trials. Such an important translational gap might be related to interspecies mechanistic differences in the folding of the mRNAs, the thermodynamic behavior of the siRNA candidates, and their interaction with their mRNA in each tissue and cellular context. Other interspecies differences might also be involved and implying: the half-life of the messenger, the stability of the target protein, the bioavailability, and biodistribution of the siRNA within target tissue. The possibility that an animal model would not adequately recapitulate the key disease characteristics should also be borne in mind, with the worst scenario being a combination of several of these factors. New approaches to complement existing rules for the design of ocular siRNAs are needed to bridge the translational gap from basic research to clinical trials; this would increase the likelihood of a successful path to advanced stages of drug development, at lower cost.

Recently, major companies in the field succeeded in solving a large part of these problems, through significant investment of human and financial resources. Indeed, Alnylam developed ONPATTRO® (patisiran) for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (a rare, debilitating and often fatal genetic disease), and GIVLAARI® (givosiran) for acute hepatic porphyria; as well as their advanced candidates lumasiran for primary hyperoxaluria type 1, and inclisiran for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Despite these impressive advances, new rational patterns of chemical modification and sequence selection are needed to improve efficacy and stability of siRNAs in target cells and tissues. Achieving effective entry of siRNAs in most tissues implies new systems for finely targeted delivery and improved endolysosomal escape that strongly limit the success rates. New approaches should allow us to design molecules adapted to tissues individually, based on tissue-specific descriptors.

Novel platforms for the design of siRNAs are being developed to bridge the translational gap alluded to above. Of note, the Arrowhead TRiM™ platform offers to design high affinity ligands with enhanced pharmacokinetics and stabilization properties. Wave Life Sciences, in collaboration with Deep Genomics Inc., uses artificial intelligence (AI) strategies to develop stereopure oligonucleotides for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, and it is also aiming at ocular therapeutic targets for the treatment of genetically defined eye diseases. Sylentis, a company specialized in the design of siRNAs for ophthalmic conditions, has developed an AI-based platform called Sirfinder®. This highly versatile platform takes into account all of the technical and regulatory specifications required in the different phases of development of an siRNA for ocular use. The structure of Sirfinder® allows the improvement of AI algorithms through feedback loops based on incoming experimental data; in the end, this learning process increases the probability of bringing a candidate drug to advanced stages of development, faster and at lower cost.

Ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central serous choroidopathy, diabetic macular edema, and corneal edema are associated with bleeding and fluid losses. Since these biological fluids contain significant ribonuclease activity, chemical modifications of siRNAs are essential to provide enhanced stability. Another type of concern was raised by Kleinman and coworkers who reported that the effect of an siRNA targeting VEGFR1 to reduce choroidal neovascularization (Sirna-027, *see* candidates section) was mediated by a nonspecific activation of TLR3 in the eye rather than the expected sequence-specific effect. A complementary study showed that TLR3 activation following IVT injection of siRNAs led to caspase-3-mediated degeneration of the RPE cells, questioning the safety of these compounds. This observation stimulated research on alternative designs of siRNAs intended for IVT injection in the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Chemical modifications that aim to reduce immunogenicity of siRNAs are particularly relevant for the treatment of retinal diseases. Chemical modification at the 2′ position of the ribose is a frequently used strategy to successfully enhance stability and escape immune recognition.

Wherever siRNA-based drugs are bioconjugates or do not entail delivery systems such as liposomes or nanoparticles, chemical modifications are critical for an siRNA to reach the retina: the molecule needs to remain intact into biological fluids *en route* to target tissues. The modifications serve to increase its exposure time to tissues and improve its bioavailability and potency.

Among the numerous chemical modifications that have been developed for RNAi therapeutics, several were studied for their possible application in the treatment of ocular diseases. The different types of chemical modifications used to improve stability are exemplified by siRNAs currently under preclinical and clinical studies for eye conditions and listed in Table 1 (and section on ocular siRNA candidates). Quark Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed QPI-1007, a modified double-stranded siRNA to inhibit caspase 2 expression in the treatment of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION); the oligonucleotide is the result of modifications to the passenger strand (inverted deoxyabasic moiety at 5′ end, L-DNA cytidine nucleotide at 3′ position) as well as to the guide strand (alternating 2′-O-methyl modifications). PF-655 or PF-04523655 (REDD14) is a second candidate from the same company to inhibit the expression of the hypoxia-inducible gene RTP801 for the treatment of wet AMD; the siRNA contains alternating 2′-O-methyl modifications. RXi Pharmaceuticals has the drug named RXI-109 that reached clinical development phase; this asymmetric siRNA is directed at the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) for the reduction of retinal scarring during wound healing in AMD patients. The extremely well designed and complementary features of the molecule include: (1) addition of a lipophilic moiety (cholesterol conjugation for efficient cellular uptake); (2) stabilizing residues (alternative 2′-O-Me, and phosphorothioate linkage for resistance to nucleases); and (3) 2′-F derivative for increased affinity and nuclease resistance. Olix Pharmaceuticals is a company that is expanding in the field of ocular diseases such as AMD and retinitis pigmentosa. It is actively implicated in the development of cell-penetrating asymmetric siRNAs (cp-asiRNA with mitigated off-target effect, as well as modifications for improved stability). Finally, Alnylam is working on targeted delivery systems for extrahepatic tissues, including the eye. Their most commonly described modifications for ocular delivery are 5′-Vinyl phosphonate and lipophilic moieties, (PS), 2′-O-Methyl, 2′-Allyl, 2′ Deoxy and 2′-Fluor, as well as non-natural nucleotides such as acyclic nucleotides LNA, CeNA and 2′-Methoxyethyl. Alnylam also uses specific ligand receptors for delivery to eye tissues such as siRNA targeting ligands from the group of trans-retinol, RGD peptide, but also LDL-receptor and carbohydrate-based ligands. Bioconjugates with specific ligands are being developed for ultrafine targeting of potent siRNAs in the treatment of ocular amyloidosis.

## 4 Delivery Systems for Ocular siRNA

Given that the stability of an siRNA is a critical determinant of its efficacy, it follows that the relatively low RNAses content in aqueous humor compared to plasma represents a major advantage in the treatment of ocular diseases over the treatment of systemic conditions. Previous stability analyses have shown that the half-life of an siRNA is up to 40 times longer in human aqueous humor than in serum. This suggests that the effect of siRNAs on ocular tissues would increase with drug exposure time, whereas siRNAs are rapidly degraded upon reaching the systemic circulation. It is noteworthy that long-term delivery systems are already recommended for enhanced permeation into ocular structures.

The diffusion of siRNAs is largely limited by their high molecular weight and negative ionic charge. Chemical modifications and delivery systems are currently used strategies, mainly for three reasons: (1) to prolong their contact time with the ocular surface, (2) to direct and transport siRNAs to defined regions of the eye, or (3) to facilitate their cellular uptake. In order to penetrate the cornea, these systems should preferably be amphiphilic and biocompatible. Amphiphilicity can be achieved by covering the siRNA with positively charged molecules, by coupling to conjugates or carriers, or by packing them into vesicles such as liposomes and nanoparticles. All together, these approaches should enable the interaction of siRNAs with ocular components such as epithelial cells and mucus. To this end, various strategies have been deployed especially for ocular therapies; the most relevant ones are briefly summarized in this section.

### 4.1 Lipid and Peptide-Based Delivery Systems

A keen interest in delivery systems for the treatment of ocular diseases arose when it was put forward that the decrease in CNV induced by Sirna-027 (anti-VEGFR1 siRNA) was partly mediated through TLR-3 activation. Thereafter, PEGylated liposomes complexed with protamine-hyaluronic acid (HA) were developed to encapsulate VEGFR1 siRNA; this system showed high efficacy both in vitro and in animal models. IVT injection of these nanoparticles resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in lesion size in a rat model of laser-induced CNV, compared to naked siRNA. In the eye, PEGylation of liposomes is used to increase vitreous diffusion, while HA, a ligand of the CD44 receptor expressed on retinal and choroidal endothelial cells, ensures delivery to the sub-retinal space. More recently, a novel siRNA-based anti-VEGF nanoball has been manufactured for the treatment of CNV. It comprises an siRNA hydrogel with a core of anti-VEGF siRNA sequence, and is coated with branched Polyethyleneimine (PEI) and HA. After IVT injection into mice, the nanoballs were visualized in the RPE and choroid, leading to 41% and 61% decrease in VEGF mRNA levels in these structures, respectively; this effect was associated with a strong reduction in CNV area after 2 weeks of treatment. In the field of diabetic retinopathy research, solid lipid nanoparticles loaded with siRNA against Human antigen R (HuR) were administered by intraocular injection into diabetic rats. Under these conditions, the lipoplexes were able to reduce both HuR and VEGF expression levels in the retina, with greater efficacy than the one produced by the naked siRNA. Interestingly, while the naked siRNA did not produce any noticeable signs of retinal protection, injection of lipoplexes resulted in significant improvement in retina thickness and number of retinal ganglion cells; such a result would suggest that these chemical structures confer enhanced penetrability or stability to siRNA in ocular tissues.

In glaucoma, CD44 expression is elevated in tissues involved in aqueous humor outflow. Based on this observation, a novel type of nanoparticle coated with HA was assembled by a layer-layer approach where the siRNA is trapped between two cationic PEI layers. Proof of concept was achieved ex vivo in donor eyes after intracameral injection: nanoparticles were shown to efficiently bind to the CD44 receptor of cells from the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal. In primary cultures of human trabecular meshwork cells, the nanoparticles loaded with siRNA against CTGF efficiently reduced its mRNA and protein levels.

Similar strategies are being explored in an effort to extend the use of nanoparticles to the topical treatment of ocular surface disorders, as the one offered by the simple instillation of eye drops. For example, a new siRNA against Heat Shock Protein 47 (HSP47) is currently under preclinical studies for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED) associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a host-targeted alloreactive response where immune-mediated phenomenon leads to fibrosis that can take place, for instance, in lacrimal and meibomian glands, ultimately causing a severe decrease in tear production and evaporation. Activated fibroblasts involved in these processes are positives for HSP47 and known to store vitamin A. In a mouse model of chronic GVHD, ocular topical instillation of this HSP47-siRNA encapsulated in Vitamin A-coupled liposomes significantly reduced lacrimal gland fibrosis and collagen deposit, and succeeded in significantly increasing tear secretion. In this model, vitamin A helps to deliver the siRNA into the fibroblasts and is an instrument in the efficient silencing of HSP47 after treatment with one daily administration. Interestingly, no further beneficial effects were seen with twice daily instillation instead of one, suggesting that a single dose per day is sufficient to reach silencing of the target gene.

Another interesting development is the use of a transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) siRNA for the treatment of corneal burn. Here, TGF-β1 siRNA was loaded into polymeric nanoparticles and shown to prevent corneal fibrosis and angiogenesis when applied topically in mice that had been subjected to alkaline corneal burn. This wound healing effect was superior to the one produced by the conventional therapy (betamethasone). More recently, siRNAs complexed with optimized liposomes have been designed for the treatment of ocular keratitis caused by *Acanthamoeba*, a group of protozoa that predominantly affect contact lens users. Encapsulation of two siRNAs directed against serine phosphatase and glycogen phosphatase mRNA of this organism into PEGylated cationic liposomes allowed enhanced ability to reduce corneal damage in mice when co-administered with chlorhexidine, the reference treatment. This study provided a new proof of concept for the use of siRNA to treat ocular surface infection.

Peptide-based strategies are also being investigated for the treatment of ocular diseases. A novel method using cationic cell-penetrating peptides that non-covalently bind siRNA has been tested for the delivery of siRNAs to the cornea after topical administration. These peptides can form nanoparticles when mixed with siRNAs in aqueous solution; the encapsulated siRNA, when administered topically in mice along with a nontoxic analog of chloroquine (an endosome disruptor), was shown to produce a 30% decrease of target gene expression in the corneal epithelium. In an analogous mechanistic approach, optimized lipid peptide-siRNA nanoparticles with different surface properties (including PEGylation) have been produced in an attempt to silence the gene coding for Myocardin-Related Transcription Factor (MRTF). Subconjunctival administration of these MRTF-B lipid-peptide nanoparticles into a rabbit model of glaucoma filtration surgery induced a 30% reduction of *MRTF-B* gene expression that was associated with improvement in bleb morphology.

On the whole, lipid-based nanoparticles have been demonstrated to provide sustained delivery of siRNAs to eye structures, as shown by tissue localization experiments, silencing ability or therapeutic benefits. Moreover, preclinical studies conducted on nanoparticles demonstrated good general safety profile, consistent with their biocompatibility and biodegradable nature. Nonetheless, special care should be taken in terms of safety assessment (biodistribution, tolerability, and elimination) to meet regulatory requirements. While cyclosporine nanomicelle ophthalmic formulation received approval by the FDA, similar strategies for the delivery of siRNA have not yet translated into clinical practice.

## 5 Quantitation and Biodistribution of siRNAs in the Eye

During the process of drug development, and in order to meet the standards set by regulatory agencies, an accurate description of the pharmacokinetic profile of therapeutic oligonucleotides requires several complementary techniques. To this end, sensitive analytical methods are now available for their quantitation in biological samples and can be applied to studies on siRNAs intended for the treatment of ocular diseases. However, there still remain numerous technical hurdles to overcome with respect to ocular biodistribution of siRNAs and its impact on their pharmacokinetics.

Measuring plasma levels and assessing tissue distribution of newly developed drugs are part of regulatory requirements. Concerning siRNAs developed for the treatment of ocular diseases, this evaluation is simplified as the medication is delivered locally to the eye via eye drops or IVT injection; this results in a marginal systemic exposure to the drug. It is critically important to determine whether the product reaches the target structures within the eye itself, and at which concentrations: ocular biodistribution studies of siRNA are thus needed in order to fully understand their pharmacokinetic properties.

The most frequently used analytical methods to quantify siRNA that can meet regulatory requirements are the followings: liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), ligand binding assay (LBA hybridization ELISA), reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and anion exchange liquid chromatography (AEX-HPLC) with fluorescence detection (DNA- or PNA-probe HPLC Assay). In the evaluation of pharmacokinetics , a strategy combining two or more complementary techniques is needed to circumvent problems with stability (e.g., effect of RNases), sensitivity (e.g., low recovery of analyte at the extraction step; low accumulating tissue) and specificity (e.g., study of metabolites). Bioanalytical methods for the measurement of plasma concentrations must be validated as per regulatory requirements; for the measurement of tissue concentrations, the methods could be fully validated or qualified (including minimum critical characteristics).

Ocular biodistribution studies entail several bioanalytical challenges. Drug concentrations can cover a wide range depending on the tissue or fluid analyzed and the chemical formulation of the siRNAs: for example, lacrimal glands can accumulate high concentrations of a given compounds while the retina could retain much lower levels. Where needed, different quantitation techniques ought to be used to cover the different concentration ranges observed in eye structures. Because the siRNA pathway operates in the cytoplasm, developing a method for the quantitation of both intra- and extracellular levels of siRNA is desirable as it can provide important pharmacokinetic and biodistribution parameters.

The biodistribution of siRNAs greatly depends on the delivery route and the chemical characteristics of the molecule. Unmodified naked siRNAs are excellent substrates for RNAses in blood and extracellular space; upon systemic injection, their rapid degradation precludes their distribution to the eye. As seen previously, chemical modification and the use of carriers are two examples of techniques that successfully allowed the preparation of more stable siRNAs. Modified siRNAs can be more stable and could target systemic organs depending on their plasma stability. They will mainly be found in the kidney and liver where they are cleared and excreted. If siRNAs are encapsulated in a delivery agent, their biodistribution will depend on the characteristics of this agent.

### 5.1 Differential Quantitation of Extra- and Intracellular Antisense Strands

An (AEX)-HPLC method coupled to fluorescence detection can be used to specifically quantitate both the non-phosphorylated antisense strand and the intracellular 5′-phosphorylated antisense strand of an siRNA. Moreover, the extent of phosphorylation of the antisense strand by polynucleotide kinase 1 is taken as an indicator of the intracellular delivery of the investigational compound. In brief, this bioanalytical method involves the hybridization of a fluorescent labeled probe (complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA) to a test biological sample, followed by fluorescence analysis. The technique was applied to the quantitation of bamosiran in tissues after topical ocular instillation in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. Bamosiran is a naked siRNA that inhibits the synthesis of β2-Adrenergic Receptor (ADRB2) protein to decrease intra-ocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. In this protocol, the probe was a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) strand complementary to the antisense strand of bamosiran. After the specific hybridization step, a first analysis using AEX-HPLC was performed, and the fraction containing the duplexes (probe/bamosiran and probe/(5′-phosphate) bamosiran) was finally separated on a Dionex DNA Pac PA200 column, improving the corresponding chromatographic method. Peak areas of the duplexes were evaluated against an external calibration curve using serial dilutions of bamosiran. The results of this ocular biodistribution study demonstrated that bamosiran was detectable after instillation of a single dose, with the cornea containing the highest concentration of the antisense strand. In the iris and ciliary body, the concentration was about 20% of that found in the cornea, indicating that the compound quickly enters these eye structures. The intact strand was also present in lacrimal glands, although at a lower level. Interestingly, the highest concentration of (5-phosphate) bamosiran was found in the ciliary body, with lower levels in the cornea, iris and lacrimal glands. Overall, the results obtained using the bioanalytical technique described above gave credence to the possible therapeutic potential of the naked unmodified siRNA by demonstrating that locally instilled bamosiran can reach structures of the anterior segment of the eye, be internalized by the cells and phosphorylated at its 5′end. Most importantly, in efficacy models, treatment of NZW rabbits with one drop of bamosiran (20 nmol/day) during 4 days produced a 40% decrease in mRNA levels of ADRB2, which was accompanied by a 20% reduction in IOP.

IVT injection has been frequently used to deliver siRNAs to the posterior segment of the eye and this way increases their concentration in eye structures such as the retina. This approach was used by Dejneka et al. who reported on the distribution of bevasiranib, an siRNA targeting VEGF-A (Table 1), following a single IVT injection in rabbit eyes. Tritium-labeled bevasiranib (tracer used for injection) was detected in several structures, but the highest concentration was found in the vitreous humor, whose concentration steadily decreased over time. In contrast, the concentration in the other ocular tissues increased to reach a maximum within 72 h.

The development of highly sensitive methods that utilize hybridization with specific probes allowed for the detection and quantification of minimal amounts siRNAs in tissues (in the μg/mL to ng/mL range). These techniques validate the application of RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of ocular diseases; indeed, active forms of siRNAs can be retrieved and precisely quantitated in different ocular structures after eye drop instillation or IVT injection. In ophthalmology, assessment of siRNAs in target and key remote tissues are requirements from regulatory agencies due to the impact on safety and efficacy parameters.

## 6 Safety of siRNA After Ocular Administration

By definition, siRNAs are chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, and they are considered as New Chemical Entities (NCEs) by Regulatory Authorities, hence pharmacology and toxicology assessment should be carried out following guidelines for NCEs. Features such as target, indication, chemical modifications, and systemic bioavailability of the RNAi-based drugs may influence the nature of the required studies.

Before first-in-human trials, drugs must demonstrate that their safety profile is acceptable in their intended indication. The general nonclinical safety guidelines require that their safety profile be evaluated in two relevant animal species, usually a rodent and a non-rodent, at three dose levels using the intended clinical route of administration and for a duration that should be similar or superior to that of the clinical trial to be carried out. Nevertheless, ICH S6 guideline states that studies should be carried out in relevant species only. This assessment should include acute or maximum tolerated dose toxicology studies and repeated-dose toxicity studies. The evaluation of systemic toxicity in at least one species is carried out by intravenous injection to maximize systemic exposure; it is generally expected before human studies can begin. Additionally, pharmacokinetics, safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and specific toxicology studies are usually required. The general rules apply to siRNAs, but a case-by-case approach should be followed for each product, and the required studies should be discussed with the competent authorities due to the unique features of these compounds.

The toxicity of siRNAs upon ocular administration depends mostly on their biodistribution and biological activity. It can be determined by sequence-dependent phenomena such as siRNA hybridization in 5′-UTR regions of unintended targets and sequence-dependent activation through TLRs and RIG-I/MDA5 activation that trigger innate immunity. Likewise, toxicity can be caused by sequence-independent phenomena, such as saturation of the RISC machinery by overdose, which can lead to miRNA dysregulation and significant toxic effects. Other toxic effects are also related to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and complement activation; it is akin to a general toxicity potential related to the chemical structure of NCEs. The information generated in the safety studies in animals must be completed with the safety information obtained from clinical trials and pharmacovigilance.

siRNAs are species specific; hence the species selected for safety assessment should carry a similar target sequence within the gene destined to be silenced. Sometimes, one or two mismatches (differences in nucleotides) to the human sequence will not reduce their activity, depending on the position that would be affected in the siRNA. In these cases, proper justification requires specific silencing studies to be carried out in the selected animal species. Bearing this in mind, selecting the appropriate species for safety studies on siRNAs closely follows the same general rules as for other ocular products. Here, the rat remains the preferred rodent species. However, ocular toxicity and pharmacokinetics studies often benefit from the use of common animal models in this particular field such as rabbit, dog, and monkey [[1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_23_Chapter.xhtml#CR1)]. A nonpigmented rabbit strain such as the NZW is usually acceptable when combined with a pigmented species (dog or primate). There is growing incentive for the use of pigmented rabbits, such as the Dutch-Belted (DB), and they are indicated when the drug is expected to bind ocular melanin.

Over the last decade, several siRNAs intended for ocular conditions have been tested in humans (Table 1), the first ones being bevasiranib followed shortly by sirna-027 which target VEGFA and VEGFR1, respectively. Both drugs were intravitreally administered to treat wet macular degeneration. The frequency and severity of reported systemic and ocular adverse events (AE) for bevasiranib as well as sirna-027 were not different from their respective comparators (IVT monoclonal antibodies). In both studies, most of the AEs were associated to the IVT injection procedure itself (e.g., retinal or conjunctival hemorrhage, vitreous detachment, cataract). While the two compounds themselves showed good safety profiles, their clinical trials were terminated in Phase 3 or 2 because of failure to meet primary efficacy endpoint.

Other siRNAs currently under clinical development by Sylentis for the treatment of eye diseases are bamosiran (indicated for glaucoma) and tivanisiran (indicated for dry eye disease). These drugs are administered as eye drops and have shown excellent tolerability in animal and human studies. During the nonclinical toxicology program of bamosiran, no drug-related ocular alterations or clinical signs were reported. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that the systemic concentration of the drug remained below the lower limit of detection at all time-points or doses tested, thus minimizing the possibility of systemic AEs. In Phase I study, no drug-related AEs were reported, neither locally nor systemically, regardless of the dose and administration schedule. Moreover, bamosiran was not detected in plasma samples at any time point. In Phase II studies, no serious AEs were reported and no differences in rate of AE occurrence were found between treatment arms and/or vehicle group. Similar findings were made during the preclinical and clinical developments of tivanisiran, indicating that both of these siRNAs, administered as eye drops, share an excellent safety profile.

To date, no siRNA has yet been approved for the treatment of ocular diseases . As for other types of indications, Alnylam developed two siRNAs that have been approved in several countries. The first one, patisiran, is encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles for delivery directed to the liver. Although the main side effects reported for Onpattro were infusion-related reactions, ocular safety was specially monitored during clinical development program. Firstly, amyloid deposition in ocular structures frequently results in complications such as vitreous opacity, vision impairment, dry eye, or glaucoma . The second reason is intrinsically related to serum TTR function. Serum wild-type TTR acts as a carrier of retinol binding protein (RBP) that facilitates transport of vitamin A (retinol) in the blood. Patisiran reduces both wild-type and mutant TTR as it targets a genetically conserved sequence in the untranslated region of both mutant and wild-type TTR mRNA. Inevitably, patisiran silencing results in reduced serum levels of both RBP and vitamin A, which are essential for rod and cone photoreceptors. Although no evidence of ocular vitamin A deficiency was found during the clinical development program of patisiran, both FDA and EMA agreed to include a warning in patisiran’s leaflet stating that vitamin A levels below the inferior limit of normal should be corrected with oral supplementation. Referral for ophthalmological assessment is also recommended if patients develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency, including reduced night vision or night blindness, persistent dry eyes, eye inflammation or corneal thickening, among others. The second approved siRNA, givosiran, is administered via subcutaneous injection once monthly; the most frequent (>25%) side effects are nausea and reactions at the site of injection.

There are several additional siRNA-based drugs in late stage of development that are expected to obtain approval in the near future; this should generate additional safety data most useful for the design of innocuous delivery system of siRNA. So far, the AEs reported upon ocular and systemic treatments with siRNA relate more to the mode of administration rather than to specific properties of siRNAs.

## 7 Current Status of Ocular siRNA Candidates

Since the introduction of RNAi in the field of ophthalmology, a growing number of candidates have reached preclinical and clinical development stages for the treatment of ocular diseases. This last section documents the status of ocular siRNAs and a detailed list is presented in Table [1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_23_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1).

For a time, most of the efforts in siRNA development were concentrated on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) , the leading cause of vision loss in developed countries. The wet form of the disease (wAMD) is characterized the abnormal growth of fragile blood vessels emanating from the subjacent choroid and invading the RPE and the subretinal space. These newly formed vessels have an increased likelihood to leak blood and serum causing disruption of retinal structures and triggering degenerative changes involving cell loss, eventual fibrosis, and scar tissue formation. This process, also known as CNV, is mediated by VEGF. The first-ever clinical trial with an siRNA was conducted in 2004. Bevasiranib (Cand5), a naked unmodified compound developed by Acuity Pharmaceuticals and later by Opko Health, was rationally designed to target VEGF mRNA. Phase I study was conducted in patients with active CNV associated with wAMD. Single IVT injections of ascending doses of bevasiranib were administered to obtain preliminary tolerability and efficacy data. In 2005, bevasiranib was advanced into Phase II to test safety and efficacy of the compound for an extended treatment period .

Almost simultaneously, the clinical development of AGN211745 , previously known as Sirna-027, was initiated by Allergan and Sirna Therapeutics. The compound is an unmodified naked siRNA designed to target VEGFR1 mRNA in patients with CNV secondary to AMD . A Phase I clinical trial was started in 2004 to study safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and dose-limiting toxicity of single IVT injection of AGN211745. Results showed that single IVT ascending doses of AGN211745 were well tolerated, while visual acuity and foveal thickness stabilized or improved. At that time, bevasiranib was already at a Phase III study (COBALT) to determine the effect on visual acuity and the optimum dose-regimen of ITV injections as maintenance therapy for AMD patients previously treated with Lucentis® (ranibizumab). Similarly, AGN21745 was moved into Phase II to assess the effect of different dose-levels on visual acuity as compared to ranibizumab. In 2009, both clinical trials were terminated not for safety reasons, but for not achieving improved efficacy over ranibizumab, the reference treatment.

Research on RNAi therapeutics for retinal disorders was resumed by Quark Pharmaceuticals with PF-655, a 19-nt 2′O-methyl-stabilized siRNA targeting RTP801, which was later fully licensed to Pfizer. RTP801 is a stress-induced adaptor protein that inhibits mTOR function and whose expression is rapidly upregulated in response to ischemia, hypoxia and/or oxidative stress. IVT injection of PF-655 in preclinical animal models of laser-induced CNV led to inhibition of RTP801 independently of TLR activation, expression of anti-angiogenic and neurotrophic factors, and subsequent reduction of CNV volume, vessel leakage and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the choroid.

PF-655 was studied in a Phase I and in one Phase II study (MONET) for the treatment of wAMD. MONET trial showed that PF-655 produced increasing improvements in mean visual acuity over the first 3-month period and that the combination with ranibizumab was more efficient than ranibizumab in monotherapy. Additionally, PF-655 was studied in two Phase II clinical trials (DEGAS and MATISSE) for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), a complication of diabetic retinopathy. DEGAS study showed that treatment with PF-655 over a period of 12 months caused a dose-dependent improvement in visual acuity when compared to patients treated with laser photocoagulation. Despite initial promising results, very little information regarding PF-655 can be found after MATISSE study completion in 2014.

The same company has another compound, QPI-1007 undergoing clinical trials. This siRNA was designed to block the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein caspase 2, thus inhibiting apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells and preventing vision loss in patients suffering from NAION. QPI-1007 (IVT injection) has been studied for this indication in a Phase I clinical trial, which showed good tolerance, and in Phase II/III trial that was terminated early since interim analysis did not warrant enrolment. QPI-1007 is also under earlier stages of development for the treatment of acute primary closed angle glaucoma, a disease that also leads to blindness through damage of the optic nerve, in this case as a consequence of elevated IOP.

Bamosiran , formerly known as SYL040012, is a canonical siRNA targeting ADRB2 which is being developed by Sylentis for the treatment of ocular hypertension and open angle glaucoma. Glaucoma is a group of ocular pathologies characterized by optic nerve damage as a consequence of sustained IOP above physiological limits. Commercially available ocular beta blockers are able to effectively reduce IOP by intercepting aqueous humor secretion pathways; however, cardiovascular and respiratory side effects are frequently reported as these molecules reach bloodstream when topically administered in the eye. One of the major advantages of bamosiran is its limited systemic bioavailability, thus minimizing the possibility of systemic adverse effects. This was confirmed in the PK analysis performed in healthy volunteers and patients during Phase I studies. Subsequently, a 14-day dose-finding placebo-controlled and a 28-day active-controlled (SYLTAG) trial were carried out. Results showed that bamosiran was able to efficiently reduce IOP; however, superiority versus timolol was not achieved. Good local and systemic tolerability was observed in all clinical trials conducted with bamosiran.

Sylentis is also responsible for the development of tivanisiran (SYL1001), a naked 19-nt siRNA-targeting transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) ; it is administered in eye drops for Dry Eye Disease (DED). DED is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface whose most common signs and symptoms are burning, itching, redness, dryness, pain and photophobia. TRPV1 represents an attractive target for reducing signs and symptoms of DED due to its dual function in corneal tissues: (1) it participates in ocular pain sensing, transmission and regulation, (2) it acts as a mediator of innate inflammatory response.

Local and systemic tolerability results of Phase I clinical trial fostered tivanisiran into Phase II clinical trials. Two placebo-controlled dose-finding studies were conducted to determine the effect of four different doses of tivanisiran (10 days of treatment) in patients with mild to moderate ocular pain associated to DED. The dose showing the highest improvement in pain scores (symptom) and corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) was selected to initiate a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial (HELIX). Results showed improvement in central CFS when compared to placebo. Although no statistical significance was achieved for ocular symptoms, *post-ho*c analysis suggested a higher effect for tivanisiran in the most severely affected patients. The effect of tivanisiran on DED subpopulations will be further explored in subsequent clinical trials.

The eye has become the center of activity of several R&D programs. Companies such as OliXPharmaceuticals are exploring new modalities of siRNAs with enhanced RNAi triggering properties. Their proprietary technology of cell-penetrating asymmetric siRNAs (cp-asiRNAs) allows efficient internalization without delivery vehicles. OliX Pharmaceuticals partnered with Théa to foster the development of its leading candidate, OLX301A, for the treatment of both dry and wet AMD. Other candidates for the treatment of ocular pathologies, such as OLX301D for subretinal fibrosis, OLX301J for AMD, and OLX304A for retinitis pigmentosa are in preclinical stages.

MicroCures has developed a proprietary siRNA-based drug candidate called siFi2, designed to silence the activity of Fidgetine-Like2, a key negative regulator of cell migration. Topical application of a formulation of siFi2 to murine models of excision and burn wounds accelerated the rate and improved the quality of wound repair. This candidate is currently being developed for the treatment of corneal burn repair and dermal injuries.

Sylentis is finalizing the launch of SYL1801 into Phase I clinical trials. This candidate is a modified siRNA inhibitor of Notch-Regulated Ankyrin Repeat Protein (NRARP), a key regulator of CNV. All available therapies for this disease are injected by the intravitreal route whereas SYL1801 is formulated as eye drops. Nonclinical biodistribution studies proved SYL1801 bioavailability in the retina after administration in eye drops. Additionally, SYL1801 eye drops significantly reduced areas of neovascularization in the retina of a rat model of LASER-induced CNV.

Alnylam is also exploring eye-targeted delivery systems, and has disclosed limited preclinical data related to the potent and durable silencing effect achieved after single IVT injection of a siRNA conjugate targeting transthyretin (TTR) in rats and nonhuman primates.

## 8 Conclusion

The approval of patisiran and givosiran, together with the number of promising siRNA candidates in advanced clinical stages, is a most encouraging achievement that will undoubtedly stimulate the emergence of new siRNA-based therapeutics in the coming years, especially we hope for ophthalmic indications. More so, the eye is an organ endowed, like no other, with major advantages for the use of siRNAs: (i) accessibility, allowing for straight on-site delivery; (ii) isolation, minimizing systemic dispersion and off-site adverse effects; (iii) immune-privileged environment, limiting immune-related ocular toxicities; and (iv) low RNase content, enhancing local bioavailability and dose-level optimization. Moreover, innovative nucleotide designing and delivery systems of siRNAs focused on particular ocular tissues, should open up new avenues for the treatment of eye disorders.
