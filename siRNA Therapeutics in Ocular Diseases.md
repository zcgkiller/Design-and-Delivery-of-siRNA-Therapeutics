## Abstract 摘要

The field of RNAi therapeutics has quickly adapted to the treatment of ocular diseases. Although the eye provides a unique system for the delivery of siRNAs, its complex structure and composition fostered the development of novel strategies for efficient gene silencing in the target compartment. Moreover, anterior and posterior segments differ in their multiple drug barriers and clearance mechanisms. This chapter summarizes the recent achievements in terms of routes of administration, chemical modifications, and delivery systems for siRNAs that specifically apply to eye disorders. Methods employed for siRNA detection/quantitation in ocular tissues are also described, together with safety concerns that need to be addressed to fulfill regulatory requirements of new drug approval. Even though RNAi therapies for ocular diseases have not yet translated into patient care, we document herein the rising number of candidate drugs currently under preclinical or clinical development.

## 1 Introduction 前言

Ever since RNAi was defined as a ubiquitous, naturally occurring cellular process, the potential for siRNAs to move from research to pharmaceuticals led to a transformative era in drug development. Given the propitious conditions of the eye, ophthalmology was the first therapeutic area where the potential of siRNAs was weighted high and at hand. However, while several RNAi-based therapies were approved in the last years, such breakthrough is still awaited in the field of ocular diseases. Unarguably, several basic and technical issues need to be overcome to obtain increased stability, proper delivery, and bioavailability of siRNAs in eye tissues. In this chapter, we review the pathophysiological particularities of the eye in the context of the new advances in molecular design and delivery systems that have been applied to ocular siRNA candidates, alongside matching safety observations.

<span style=color:blue>自RNA干扰（RNAi）被发现是一种广泛存在的天然细胞过程以来，siRNA从基础研究向药物开发的转化为药物研发开启了一个革命性的新时代。眼部独特的生理条件使其成为首个被广泛研究siRNA潜力的治疗领域。然而，尽管近年来已有多种RNAi疗法获得批准，用于治疗眼科疾病的突破性成果尚未出现。为进一步提升siRNA在眼组织中的稳定性、有效递送和生物利用度，仍需解决诸多技术与基础问题。本章聚焦眼部的病理生理特性，探讨最新的分子设计与递送系统的应用进展，这些进展推动了眼科siRNA候选药物的发展，并结合相应的安全性研究进行了综述。</span>

## 2 Ocular Structures and Modalities for siRNA Administration 眼部结构与siRNA递送的方式

The special localization and ready accessibility of the eye make it an attractive organ for the development of RNAi therapeutics. This site allows a local, almost direct delivery of siRNAs, circumventing some of the difficulties encountered with systemic administration. The overall size of the eye and its different anatomical compartments are rather small, thus requiring the administration of relatively low amounts of compounds at lower associated cost. While the remarkable potential of siRNAs for the treatment of ocular diseases has been quickly appreciated, filling the technological gap toward its clinical application remains a challenge.

<span style=color:blue>眼睛因其独特的位置和便捷的可达性，成为RNAi治疗药物开发的理想靶点。通过局部直接递送siRNA，能够规避全身给药中的许多挑战。此外，眼睛整体体积小、解剖分区细微，因此药物用量较少，相关研发成本也随之降低。尽管siRNA在治疗眼病方面的巨大潜力已广泛被认可，但要将这一技术真正应用于临床仍需克服不少技术难题。</span>

The eye functions to transmit external sensory stimuli to the brain: upon reaching the retina, light rays are transformed into images that are transmitted to the visual cortex for reconstitution. This process is made possible owing to the transparency of the ocular structures, which requires the maintenance of a specialized environment. The eye contains a myriad of barriers that offer protection against external aggression and preserve eye integrity by hindering the passage of xenobiotics to its innermost regions. In the end, the complexity of this organ poses several limitations when trying to reach a therapeutic concentration of a given medication in the target compartment. Delivery to a particular ocular tissue may be achieved using one of the following routes of administration: topical (eye drops), punctal and intrascleral, or by different types of injections such as periocular, subconjunctival, subretinal, suprachoroidal, sub-Tenon’s, intravitreal and directly into the anterior chamber. A diagram of the different modes of ocular administration is presented in Fig. 1. The decision as to which represents the most appropriate route depends upon the nature of the drug, target tissue, and disease. The current section focuses on the two most common routes of administration—topical (ophthalmic) and intravitreal—that have been applied to siRNA therapeutics, and describes the different ocular structures that may influence drug biodistribution and ability to reach target compartments, along with the potential benefits and disadvantages of each route.

<span style=color:blue>眼睛的主要功能是将外界光信号传递至大脑：光线经过视网膜转化为图像，再由视觉皮层进行重建。这一过程依赖于眼部结构的透明性，而维持这一特性需要一个高度专业化的内环境。此外，眼睛存在多种屏障，这些屏障不仅能够抵御外界侵袭，还能阻止外源性物质进入眼内深部，从而保护眼部的完整性。然而，眼睛复杂的结构也为药物到达靶组织并维持治疗浓度带来了很大的挑战。针对眼部特定区域的药物递送，可采用多种给药方式，例如滴眼、泪小管和巩膜内递送，或者通过多种注射方式，包括眼周、结膜下、视网膜下、脉络膜上、Tenon囊下、玻璃体内及前房内注射等。图1展示了这些眼部递送方法的模式图。具体选择哪种递送方式，取决于药物特性、靶组织以及所治疗的疾病。本节将重点介绍siRNA治疗中最常用的两种递送方式——局部滴眼和玻璃体内注射，同时分析可能影响药物分布和靶向能力的眼部结构，并探讨每种途径的优势和局限性。</span>

**Fig. 1** Routes of administration for ocular drugs. Ocular medications can be delivered topically by eye drops instillation (**a**) by intraocular injection via the periocular (**b**), suprachoroidal (**c**) and intravitreal routes (**d**), and by mean of controlled release devices (**e**). Absorption of siRNAs mainly occurs via the conjunctival-scleral route (**f**)

### 2.1 Topical Administration 局部给药

Topical administration is by far the preferred route of ocular application as it provides an easy and non-invasive method for the self-administration of eye drops at home. However, the ocular structures raise multiple barriers to the entry of drugs such as siRNAs: hence, compounds administered as drops scarcely reach the back of the eye, and, in consequence, their use is generally limited to the treatment of disorders affecting the anterior segment. The anterior segment comprises the ocular surface followed by the cornea and the anterior chamber (filled with its aqueous humor), along with the iris, the ciliary body, the lens, and the conjunctiva; all together, these structures form the static barriers that prevent the passage of foreign materials. In addition, the action of metabolic and dynamic barriers hampers the entry of a host of compounds. The tear film first offers an important dynamic resistance as it undergoes a regular turnover that shortens the contact time of instilled compounds with the ocular surface. Eye treatments can also be washed out by lacrimation or the blinking reflex induced by the application of a large volume of fluid (30–40 μL for a drop versus a mean of about 6 μL for tear fluid). In addition, up to 80% of an eye drop can be drained through the nasolacrimal duct; as a result, it was estimated that topically instilled drugs remain on the ocular surface no longer than 15–30 s. Consequently, for an siRNA to be internalized, it must efficiently cross the tear film barrier and rapidly reach corneal or conjunctival tissues.

<span style=color:blue>局部给药因其操作简单且无需侵入性手术，是目前眼部治疗的首选方式。患者可以轻松在家通过滴眼液实现自我管理。然而，眼部的解剖结构为药物如siRNA的有效递送设置了重重障碍。滴眼液中的药物通常难以穿透到眼后段，因此局部给药更多地用于治疗眼前段相关的疾病。眼前段主要包括眼表、角膜、前房（充满房水）、虹膜、睫状体、晶状体和结膜，这些组织形成了有效阻止外源物质进入的静态屏障。同时，代谢屏障和动态屏障的存在也进一步限制了药物的有效吸收。例如，泪膜的快速更新会缩短药物与眼表的接触时间；此外，滴眼液可能因流泪或过多液体（滴眼液每滴30–40 μL，而泪液平均容量约为6 μL）引发的眨眼反射而被迅速冲走。据估算，高达80%的滴眼液会经鼻泪管排出，这使得局部药物在眼表的停留时间通常不会超过15–30秒。因此，要使siRNA能够被有效吸收，必须首先高效穿透泪膜屏障，并迅速到达角膜或结膜组织。</span>

The cornea is a complex structure whose function is to transmit incident light, this is made possible by maintaining transparency and controlling fluid diffusion. It is highly innervated with sensory fibers and ranks as one of the most sensitive tissues of the body. To guarantee its transparency, the cornea is not irrigated by blood vessels; if vascularization takes place (also termed as corneal neovascularization), vision becomes drastically compromised. Five distinct layers compose the cornea: an epithelium, the Bowman’s membrane, a thick stroma, the Descemet’s membrane, and an endothelium. The numerous strata of epithelial cells are densely packed and joined by several tight junctions, thus providing an effective barrier against foreign substances. Next to the cornea (at the junction with the sclera), lies the conjunctiva , a tissue composed of the epithelium, with goblet cells and accessory lacrimal glands (glands of Krause) which function to lubricate the eye by producing mucus and tears, respectively. The conjunctiva has prominent sensory innervation and, contrary to the cornea, is highly vascularized with small vessels. Blood and lymphatic vessels provide a dynamic mode of drug clearance that hinders drug penetration. Finally, resident cells of the conjunctiva, such as macrophages, melanocytes, T, and B lymphocytes, participate in immune surveillance against pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLR) expressed on macrophages, dendritic cells, corneal, and retinal epithelium can control ocular innate immune response. Some siRNAs have been shown to activate TLR and stimulate immune response and wound healing. These off-target effects along with strategies to avoid them will be further described in the next sections. Overall, it is estimated that less than 5% of drugs administered as eye drop eventually reach the aqueous humor, and once inside, might be quickly drained via the trabecular meshwork.

<span style=color:blue>角膜是一种复杂的组织，其主要功能是透射入射光，这依赖于角膜的透明性和对液体扩散的精确控制。作为人体最敏感的组织之一，角膜富含感觉神经纤维。为了保持透明性，角膜没有血管分布；一旦发生血管化（如角膜新生血管的形成），视力可能会受到严重影响。角膜由五层结构组成，包括上皮层、Bowman膜、基质层、Descemet膜和内皮层。角膜上皮细胞排列紧密，并通过紧密连接形成了强大的屏障，有效阻止外来物质进入。位于角膜旁的结膜（在与巩膜的交界处）由上皮组织构成，含有杯状细胞和附属泪腺（如Krause腺），分别分泌粘液和泪液以润滑眼睛。结膜与角膜不同，血管分布密集，含有大量的小血管，并具有显著的感觉神经分布。血液和淋巴循环提供了一种动态的药物清除途径，从而限制药物的有效渗透。此外，结膜中的免疫细胞，如巨噬细胞、黑色素细胞、T细胞和B细胞，能够对病原体进行免疫监测。角膜和视网膜上皮细胞、巨噬细胞以及树突状细胞表达的Toll样受体（TLR）能够调控眼部的先天免疫反应。有研究表明，一些siRNA可以激活TLR，进而刺激免疫反应和促进伤口愈合。有关这些非靶向效应及其规避策略将在后续章节中详细讨论。总体来说，据统计，滴眼液中最终能够到达房水的药物不足5%，而一旦进入房水，也可能迅速通过小梁网被排出，从而进一步限制了药物的作用时间和效果。</span>

In regard to absorption pathways, a topically applied compound can enter by either crossing the cornea to reach the aqueous humor or by the conjunctival-scleral route . Absorption can occur via transcellular or paracellular passage (through or between cells, respectively), as well as by a combination of both. The epithelia of the cornea and conjunctiva form highly lipophilic structures that provide greater permeability to lipophilic drugs. Generally, the cornea allows the entry of small lipophilic molecules, while large hydrophilic drugs are predominantly absorbed via the conjunctival pathway. Consistent with these observations, previous studies conducted on naked non-modified siRNA applied as eye drops have shown that their absorption occurs mainly via the paracellular route of the conjunctiva. This route can be appreciated in Fig. 1, at the junction between the conjunctiva and sclera, which may course from the lower part to the back of the eye.

<span style=color:blue>关于药物的吸收途径，局部滴眼的化合物可以通过两种方式被吸收：一是穿过角膜进入房水，二是通过结膜-巩膜途径到达眼部组织。吸收可以通过穿越细胞（穿细胞途径）或经过细胞间隙（旁细胞途径）进行，或者两种方式共同作用。角膜和结膜的上皮层具有高度的脂溶性，因此对脂溶性药物的通透性更高。通常来说，小分子脂溶性药物更容易通过角膜进入，而大分子亲水性药物则主要通过结膜途径吸收。根据此前的研究结果，非修饰的裸siRNA以滴眼液形式应用时，其吸收主要依赖于结膜的旁细胞途径。这一吸收路径可以在图1中看到，即从结膜和巩膜交界处开始，可能从眼睛下部延伸到后部。</span>

In addition to requiring multiple instillations, topical administration generally leads to low drug concentrations in the back of the eye, and alternatives are being sought in order to overcome these most serious limitations.

<span style=color:blue>然而，局部给药通常需要频繁滴药，这导致眼后部的药物浓度较低，限制了其治疗效果。因此，研究人员正在寻找新的替代方法，以克服这些关键的不足。</span>

### 2.2 Intravitreal Administration 璃体内注射

Ever since the introduction of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) therapies, intravitreal (IVT) drug delivery has become the most common procedure for the treatment of retinal diseases . Using this method, therapeutic solutions or suspensions are injected into the vitreous humor through a high-gauge needle. As this procedure bypasses the natural barriers of the eye, it is considered as the most efficient way to deliver compounds to the posterior segment of the eye. Unfortunately, one important route of drug clearance operates through a mechanism of diffusion to the anterior chamber or via the blood retinal barrier, which separates the eye from systemic circulation. Dynamic clearance may also occur through the choroid, a vascular layer localized between the sclera and retina, and that collects the bulk of the ocular blood flow. As for the multidrug resistance ABC transporters localized at the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), they actively expel xenobiotics to the choroid; however, this active efflux process is not a matter of concern when using siRNA therapeutics.

<span style=color:blue>自从抗VEGF疗法问世以来，玻璃体内注射（IVT）已成为治疗视网膜疾病的首选方法。该技术通过细针将药物溶液或悬浮液直接注射到玻璃体腔中，由于能够绕过眼睛的天然屏障，因此被认为是递送药物至眼后段最有效的方式。然而，药物也会通过扩散至前房或通过血视网膜屏障清除，后者将眼部与全身循环隔离。此外，动态清除可能发生在脉络膜中，这是一层位于巩膜与视网膜之间的高度血管化组织，承担大部分眼部血流量的收集功能。虽然视网膜色素上皮细胞上的ABC转运蛋白可将外源物主动排至脉络膜，但对于siRNA药物来说，这种清除机制并不会显著影响疗效。</span>

Besides the need for anesthesia and antisepsis, IVT injections are associated with numerous side effects such as endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and cataracts, among others. For these reasons, alternatives are also being sought to avoid the use of intraocular injections. Despite all of the possible adverse events, most of previous and ongoing studies on the treatment of retinal diseases using siRNA drugs were locked into the use of ITV injections for optimal tissue penetration and cellular uptake.

<span style=color:blue>玻璃体内注射还需要配合麻醉和严格的无菌操作，并可能引发如眼内炎、视网膜脱离和白内障等副作用。正因如此，研究人员正在探索无需眼内注射的替代方案。然而，即使存在上述不良事件，现有的和正在进行的多数siRNA药物治疗视网膜疾病的研究仍然选择玻璃体内注射，因为它能提供最佳的药物渗透性和细胞摄取效率。</span>

## 3 Design of siRNA for Ocular Therapy 治疗眼部疾病的siRNA设计

As documented for other tissues, the design of effective siRNAs for the treatment of ocular diseases is based on rules that take into account the presence of specific motifs or regions in the sequence, as well as thermodynamic parameters governing their interaction with the RISC machinery and accessibility to the target mRNA. For instance, the first rule proposed by Elbashir et al. state that “Duplexes of 21 nt siRNAs with 2 nt 3′ overhangs were the most efficient triggers of sequence-specific mRNA degradation”. Several authors also emphasized the importance of the thermodynamic properties of siRNAs in producing efficient gene silencing of a specific target mRNA. However, one of the limitations of some of these empirical rules is that they apply only to small-scale datasets and focus on certain specific genes. While these rules proved decisive for the development of effective siRNAs in several species (human, rat, mouse), significant setbacks happened when trying to select the best siRNA candidate drug to be advanced into clinical trials. Such an important translational gap might be related to interspecies mechanistic differences in the folding of the mRNAs, the thermodynamic behavior of the siRNA candidates, and their interaction with their mRNA in each tissue and cellular context. Other interspecies differences might also be involved and implying: the half-life of the messenger, the stability of the target protein, the bioavailability, and biodistribution of the siRNA within target tissue. The possibility that an animal model would not adequately recapitulate the key disease characteristics should also be borne in mind, with the worst scenario being a combination of several of these factors. New approaches to complement existing rules for the design of ocular siRNAs are needed to bridge the translational gap from basic research to clinical trials; this would increase the likelihood of a successful path to advanced stages of drug development, at lower cost.

<span style=color:blue>如同其他组织的研究所表明，设计用于治疗眼部疾病的有效siRNA需要遵循一定的规则，这些规则既考虑到特定的序列结构和区域，也要考虑到热力学参数，这些参数决定了siRNA与RNA诱导沉默复合物（RISC）相互作用的效率以及其对靶mRNA的可接近性。例如，Elbashir等人提出的第一条规则指出，“具有2个核苷酸3′悬垂的21个核苷酸siRNA双链是最有效的序列特异性mRNA降解激活因子”。一些研究者也强调了siRNA的热力学性质对于实现特定靶mRNA的有效基因沉默至关重要。然而，这些经验规则的局限性在于，它们只适用于小规模的实验数据集，并且主要关注特定基因的沉默。尽管这些规则在多个物种（如人类、大鼠、小鼠）中对有效siRNA的开发起到了决定性作用，但在选择最佳的siRNA候选药物并推进临床试验时，仍然存在显著挑战。这个转化性差距可能与物种间mRNA折叠机制、siRNA候选药物的热力学行为及其在不同组织和细胞环境中的相互作用差异有关。其他物种间的差异也可能发挥作用，比如信使RNA的半衰期、靶蛋白的稳定性、siRNA在靶组织中的生物利用度和生物分布。此外，动物模型可能无法充分重现关键的疾病特征，因此可能会出现多个因素叠加影响的最差情况。为了弥补从基础研究到临床试验的转化性差距，迫切需要新的方法来完善现有的眼科siRNA设计规则，这将增加药物开发成功进入后期阶段的机会，并降低研发成本。</span>

Recently, major companies in the field succeeded in solving a large part of these problems, through significant investment of human and financial resources. Indeed, Alnylam developed ONPATTRO® (patisiran) for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (a rare, debilitating and often fatal genetic disease), and GIVLAARI® (givosiran) for acute hepatic porphyria; as well as their advanced candidates lumasiran for primary hyperoxaluria type 1, and inclisiran for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Despite these impressive advances, new rational patterns of chemical modification and sequence selection are needed to improve efficacy and stability of siRNAs in target cells and tissues. Achieving effective entry of siRNAs in most tissues implies new systems for finely targeted delivery and improved endolysosomal escape that strongly limit the success rates. New approaches should allow us to design molecules adapted to tissues individually, based on tissue-specific descriptors.

<span style=color:blue>近年来，眼科领域的主要企业通过大量的人力和财力投入，成功解决了其中的许多难题。Alnylam公司开发了ONPATTRO®（patisiran），用于治疗遗传性转甲状腺素介导的多神经病，这是一种罕见、致命且致残的遗传病；还开发了GIVLAARI®（givosiran），用于急性肝卟啉症的治疗；此外，该公司还推出了lumasiran用于1型原发性高草酸尿症的治疗和inclisiran用于高胆固醇血症的治疗。尽管取得了这些显著的进展，仍然需要新的合理化学修饰和序列选择方案，以提高siRNA在靶细胞和组织中的效能和稳定性。要实现siRNA在大多数组织中的有效入驻，需要新型的靶向递送系统和优化的内溶酶体逃逸机制，这些因素目前在很大程度上限制了成功率。因此，新方法的设计应该基于组织特异性的描述符，定制出适合特定组织的分子。</span>

Novel platforms for the design of siRNAs are being developed to bridge the translational gap alluded to above. Of note, the Arrowhead TRiM™ platform offers to design high affinity ligands with enhanced pharmacokinetics and stabilization properties. Wave Life Sciences, in collaboration with Deep Genomics Inc., uses artificial intelligence (AI) strategies to develop stereopure oligonucleotides for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, and it is also aiming at ocular therapeutic targets for the treatment of genetically defined eye diseases. Sylentis, a company specialized in the design of siRNAs for ophthalmic conditions, has developed an AI-based platform called Sirfinder®. This highly versatile platform takes into account all of the technical and regulatory specifications required in the different phases of development of an siRNA for ocular use. The structure of Sirfinder® allows the improvement of AI algorithms through feedback loops based on incoming experimental data; in the end, this learning process increases the probability of bringing a candidate drug to advanced stages of development, faster and at lower cost.

<span style=color:blue>为了弥补上述提到的转化性差距，许多新型siRNA设计平台正在开发中。值得关注的是，Arrowhead公司通过其TRiM™平台，提供了设计具有高亲和力且具增强药代动力学和稳定化特性的配体的方案。Wave Life Sciences公司与Deep Genomics Inc.合作，利用人工智能（AI）策略开发用于治疗中枢神经系统疾病的立体纯度寡核苷酸，并且该公司也正在瞄准眼科治疗靶点，用于治疗基因特定的眼科疾病。专注于眼科siRNA设计的公司Sylentis，开发了一个基于AI的设计平台——Sirfinder®。这一高效平台能够考虑到开发眼科siRNA药物过程中各阶段所需的所有技术和监管要求。Sirfinder®的设计结构允许通过反馈回路，不断根据实验数据改进AI算法；这种学习过程能够显著提高药物研发的成功率，同时加快进程并降低成本。</span>

Ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central serous choroidopathy, diabetic macular edema, and corneal edema are associated with bleeding and fluid losses. Since these biological fluids contain significant ribonuclease activity, chemical modifications of siRNAs are essential to provide enhanced stability. Another type of concern was raised by Kleinman and coworkers who reported that the effect of an siRNA targeting VEGFR1 to reduce choroidal neovascularization (Sirna-027, *see* candidates section) was mediated by a nonspecific activation of TLR3 in the eye rather than the expected sequence-specific effect. A complementary study showed that TLR3 activation following IVT injection of siRNAs led to caspase-3-mediated degeneration of the RPE cells, questioning the safety of these compounds. This observation stimulated research on alternative designs of siRNAs intended for IVT injection in the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Chemical modifications that aim to reduce immunogenicity of siRNAs are particularly relevant for the treatment of retinal diseases. Chemical modification at the 2′ position of the ribose is a frequently used strategy to successfully enhance stability and escape immune recognition.

<span style=color:blue>眼科疾病，如年龄相关性黄斑变性（AMD）、中央性浆液性脉络膜病变、糖尿病性黄斑水肿和角膜水肿，常伴随出血和液体丧失。由于这些生物液体中含有显著的核糖核酸酶活性，因此对siRNA进行化学修饰以提高其稳定性显得尤为重要。Kleinman及其同事指出，靶向VEGFR1的siRNA（Sirna-027，*参见*候选药物部分）在减少脉络膜新生血管生成的效果中，并非通过预期的序列特异性作用，而是通过非特异性激活眼部TLR3。这一发现也表明，IVT注射siRNA后，TLR3的激活会引发通过caspase-3介导的视网膜色素上皮细胞退化，从而对这些化合物的安全性提出了质疑。这一发现推动了有关治疗脉络膜新生血管生成（CNV）的IVT注射用siRNA替代设计的研究。针对视网膜疾病的siRNA化学修饰尤为重要，尤其是降低免疫原性方面的修饰。通常，核糖2′位置的化学修饰是常用的策略，能显著提高siRNA的稳定性并避免免疫系统的识别。</span>

Wherever siRNA-based drugs are bioconjugates or do not entail delivery systems such as liposomes or nanoparticles, chemical modifications are critical for an siRNA to reach the retina: the molecule needs to remain intact into biological fluids *en route* to target tissues. The modifications serve to increase its exposure time to tissues and improve its bioavailability and potency.

<span style=color:blue>无论siRNA药物是否是生物缀合物，或是否使用如脂质体和纳米颗粒等递送系统，化学修饰对确保siRNA能够到达视网膜至关重要。因为该分子需要在运输到靶组织的过程中保持完整，化学修饰可以延长其在组织中的暴露时间，提升其生物利用度和效力。</span>

Among the numerous chemical modifications that have been developed for RNAi therapeutics, several were studied for their possible application in the treatment of ocular diseases. The different types of chemical modifications used to improve stability are exemplified by siRNAs currently under preclinical and clinical studies for eye conditions and listed in Table 1 (and section on ocular siRNA candidates). Quark Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed QPI-1007, a modified double-stranded siRNA to inhibit caspase 2 expression in the treatment of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION); the oligonucleotide is the result of modifications to the passenger strand (inverted deoxyabasic moiety at 5′ end, L-DNA cytidine nucleotide at 3′ position) as well as to the guide strand (alternating 2′-O-methyl modifications). PF-655 or PF-04523655 (REDD14) is a second candidate from the same company to inhibit the expression of the hypoxia-inducible gene RTP801 for the treatment of wet AMD; the siRNA contains alternating 2′-O-methyl modifications. RXi Pharmaceuticals has the drug named RXI-109 that reached clinical development phase; this asymmetric siRNA is directed at the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) for the reduction of retinal scarring during wound healing in AMD patients. The extremely well designed and complementary features of the molecule include: (1) addition of a lipophilic moiety (cholesterol conjugation for efficient cellular uptake); (2) stabilizing residues (alternative 2′-O-Me, and phosphorothioate linkage for resistance to nucleases); and (3) 2′-F derivative for increased affinity and nuclease resistance. Olix Pharmaceuticals is a company that is expanding in the field of ocular diseases such as AMD and retinitis pigmentosa. It is actively implicated in the development of cell-penetrating asymmetric siRNAs (cp-asiRNA with mitigated off-target effect, as well as modifications for improved stability). Finally, Alnylam is working on targeted delivery systems for extrahepatic tissues, including the eye. Their most commonly described modifications for ocular delivery are 5′-Vinyl phosphonate and lipophilic moieties, (PS), 2′-O-Methyl, 2′-Allyl, 2′ Deoxy and 2′-Fluor, as well as non-natural nucleotides such as acyclic nucleotides LNA, CeNA and 2′-Methoxyethyl. Alnylam also uses specific ligand receptors for delivery to eye tissues such as siRNA targeting ligands from the group of trans-retinol, RGD peptide, but also LDL-receptor and carbohydrate-based ligands. Bioconjugates with specific ligands are being developed for ultrafine targeting of potent siRNAs in the treatment of ocular amyloidosis.

<span style=color:blue>在RNAi治疗药物的开发过程中，已经有多种化学修饰被提出，并且其中几种已经被应用于眼科疾病的治疗。通过当前在临床前和临床阶段的眼科siRNA研究，我们可以看到不同类型的化学修饰如何提高siRNA的稳定性，这些修饰的例子列在表1中（以及眼科siRNA候选药物部分）。Quark Pharmaceuticals Inc.开发了QPI-1007，这是一种修饰过的双链siRNA，旨在抑制非动脉前缺血性视神经病变（NAION）中的caspase 2表达。该siRNA通过对乘客链（5′端的反转脱氧基础、3′位置的L-DNA胞苷修饰）和引导链（交替2′-O-甲基修饰）进行修饰来设计。PF-655或PF-04523655（REDD14）是同一公司开发的另一个候选药物，旨在抑制低氧诱导基因RTP801的表达，用于治疗湿性年龄相关性黄斑变性（湿性AMD）；该siRNA含有交替的2′-O-甲基修饰。RXi Pharmaceuticals公司开发的RXI-109药物已进入临床阶段，这种不对称siRNA靶向结缔组织生长因子（CTGF），用于减少AMD患者伤口愈合过程中的视网膜瘢痕。该分子设计非常精细，具有以下特点：（1）通过结合疏水性基团（如胆固醇）以提高细胞的摄取；（2）采用交替2′-O-甲基和磷硫酸酯连接，增强对核糖核酸酶的耐受性；（3）2′-氟修饰，提高分子亲和力和核酸酶抗性。Olix Pharmaceuticals是一家专注于眼科疾病（如AMD和视网膜色素变性）领域的公司，正在积极开发细胞穿透性不对称siRNA（cp-asiRNA），该技术可以减少脱靶效应，并通过改进的稳定性设计提高治疗效果。最后，Alnylam公司也在开发针对外肝脏组织（包括眼部）的靶向递送系统。该公司为眼科递送设计的修饰包括5′-乙烯基膦酸盐和疏水性基团（PS）、2′-O-甲基、2′-烯丙基、2′-脱氧和2′-氟修饰，以及一些非天然的核苷如环状核苷（LNA、CeNA）和2′-甲氧基乙基。此外，Alnylam还通过特定的配体受体实现siRNA在眼部组织的递送，如反式视黄醇、RGD肽的siRNA靶向配体，以及LDL受体和碳水化合物基配体。生物缀合物和这些配体正在开发，用于在治疗眼科淀粉样变性时精准靶向有效的siRNA。</span>

## 4 Delivery Systems for Ocular siRNA 眼用siRNA的递送系统

Given that the stability of an siRNA is a critical determinant of its efficacy, it follows that the relatively low RNAses content in aqueous humor compared to plasma represents a major advantage in the treatment of ocular diseases over the treatment of systemic conditions. Previous stability analyses have shown that the half-life of an siRNA is up to 40 times longer in human aqueous humor than in serum. This suggests that the effect of siRNAs on ocular tissues would increase with drug exposure time, whereas siRNAs are rapidly degraded upon reaching the systemic circulation. It is noteworthy that long-term delivery systems are already recommended for enhanced permeation into ocular structures.

<span style=color:blue>由于siRNA的稳定性是其疗效的重要决定因素，因此与治疗全身性疾病相比，眼内液中较低的核酸酶含量成为治疗眼科疾病的一大优势。研究表明，siRNA在人体眼内液中的半衰期比在血清中长40倍，这意味着siRNA在眼部组织的作用会随着药物接触时间的延长而增强，而在进入全身循环后则迅速降解。需要注意的是，长期递送系统已经被推荐用于提高药物对眼部结构的渗透。</span>

The diffusion of siRNAs is largely limited by their high molecular weight and negative ionic charge. Chemical modifications and delivery systems are currently used strategies, mainly for three reasons: (1) to prolong their contact time with the ocular surface, (2) to direct and transport siRNAs to defined regions of the eye, or (3) to facilitate their cellular uptake. In order to penetrate the cornea, these systems should preferably be amphiphilic and biocompatible. Amphiphilicity can be achieved by covering the siRNA with positively charged molecules, by coupling to conjugates or carriers, or by packing them into vesicles such as liposomes and nanoparticles. All together, these approaches should enable the interaction of siRNAs with ocular components such as epithelial cells and mucus. To this end, various strategies have been deployed especially for ocular therapies; the most relevant ones are briefly summarized in this section.

<span style=color:blue>由于siRNA具有较大的分子量和负电荷，其扩散受到很大限制。为了克服这一点，化学修饰和递送系统是目前的主要策略，通常有以下三种目的：（1）延长与眼部表面的接触时间，（2）将siRNA精确递送到眼部的特定区域，或（3）提高其细胞摄取效率。为了顺利穿透角膜，这些递送系统需要具备良好的两亲性和生物相容性。通过为siRNA添加正电荷分子、与载体结合或将其包装成脂质体和纳米颗粒等形式，可以实现其两亲性。这些方法能够帮助siRNA与眼部的上皮细胞和粘液等成分发生有效相互作用。为此，针对眼科疾病的治疗已经部署了多种策略，本节将简要概述其中最相关的几种方法。</span>

### 4.1 Lipid and Peptide-Based Delivery Systems 脂质和肽类递送系统

A keen interest in delivery systems for the treatment of ocular diseases arose when it was put forward that the decrease in CNV induced by Sirna-027 (anti-VEGFR1 siRNA) was partly mediated through TLR-3 activation. Thereafter, PEGylated liposomes complexed with protamine-hyaluronic acid (HA) were developed to encapsulate VEGFR1 siRNA; this system showed high efficacy both in vitro and in animal models. IVT injection of these nanoparticles resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in lesion size in a rat model of laser-induced CNV, compared to naked siRNA. In the eye, PEGylation of liposomes is used to increase vitreous diffusion, while HA, a ligand of the CD44 receptor expressed on retinal and choroidal endothelial cells, ensures delivery to the sub-retinal space. More recently, a novel siRNA-based anti-VEGF nanoball has been manufactured for the treatment of CNV. It comprises an siRNA hydrogel with a core of anti-VEGF siRNA sequence, and is coated with branched Polyethyleneimine (PEI) and HA. After IVT injection into mice, the nanoballs were visualized in the RPE and choroid, leading to 41% and 61% decrease in VEGF mRNA levels in these structures, respectively; this effect was associated with a strong reduction in CNV area after 2 weeks of treatment. In the field of diabetic retinopathy research, solid lipid nanoparticles loaded with siRNA against Human antigen R (HuR) were administered by intraocular injection into diabetic rats. Under these conditions, the lipoplexes were able to reduce both HuR and VEGF expression levels in the retina, with greater efficacy than the one produced by the naked siRNA. Interestingly, while the naked siRNA did not produce any noticeable signs of retinal protection, injection of lipoplexes resulted in significant improvement in retina thickness and number of retinal ganglion cells; such a result would suggest that these chemical structures confer enhanced penetrability or stability to siRNA in ocular tissues.

<span style=color:blue>当发现通过TLR-3激活部分介导了Sirna-027（抗VEGFR1 siRNA）对CNV的抑制作用时，眼科疾病治疗的递送系统引起了广泛关注。此后，研究人员开发了聚乙二醇（PEG）修饰的脂质体，复合有蛋白质-透明质酸（HA），用于包裹VEGFR1 siRNA；这一系统在体外和动物模型中均显示出较高的疗效。将这些纳米颗粒通过IVT注射到大鼠模型中，与裸露的siRNA相比，激光诱导的CNV病变面积约减少了50%。在眼部，脂质体的PEG化用于增加玻璃体的扩散，而HA作为视网膜和脉络膜内皮细胞上CD44受体的配体，确保了siRNA的传递到视网膜下腔。最近，研究者为治疗CNV制造了一种新的基于siRNA的抗VEGF纳米球。该纳米球由抗VEGF siRNA序列的核心水凝胶组成，并涂覆有支链聚乙烯亚胺（PEI）和HA。在将其通过IVT注射到小鼠体内后，纳米球被可视化到视网膜色素上皮（RPE）和脉络膜中，导致这两个结构中VEGF mRNA水平分别降低了41%和61%；这一效应在治疗2周后与CNV面积显著减少相关联。在糖尿病视网膜病变研究领域，装载有针对人类抗原R（HuR）siRNA的固体脂质纳米颗粒通过眼内注射给药到糖尿病大鼠体内。在这种条件下，脂质体复合物能够减少视网膜中HuR和VEGF的表达水平，其疗效优于裸露的siRNA。有趣的是，虽然裸露的siRNA未能显著保护视网膜，但脂质体复合物的注射则导致视网膜厚度和视网膜神经节细胞数目的显著改善；这一结果表明，这些化学结构可能赋予siRNA在眼部组织中更好的渗透性或稳定性。</span>

In glaucoma, CD44 expression is elevated in tissues involved in aqueous humor outflow. Based on this observation, a novel type of nanoparticle coated with HA was assembled by a layer-layer approach where the siRNA is trapped between two cationic PEI layers. Proof of concept was achieved ex vivo in donor eyes after intracameral injection: nanoparticles were shown to efficiently bind to the CD44 receptor of cells from the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal. In primary cultures of human trabecular meshwork cells, the nanoparticles loaded with siRNA against CTGF efficiently reduced its mRNA and protein levels.

<span style=color:blue>在青光眼中，CD44的表达在与房水流出相关的组织中升高。基于这一观察，研究者采用分层法组装了一种新型纳米颗粒，其表面涂覆透明质酸（HA），并通过两层阳离子聚乙烯亚胺（PEI）层将siRNA夹在其中。概念验证在供体眼内的房角注射后实现：这些纳米颗粒被证明能够高效结合房角网和施莱姆管细胞上的CD44受体。在人类房角网细胞的原代培养中，加载有针对CTGF的siRNA的纳米颗粒有效降低了其mRNA和蛋白质水平。</span>

Similar strategies are being explored in an effort to extend the use of nanoparticles to the topical treatment of ocular surface disorders, as the one offered by the simple instillation of eye drops. For example, a new siRNA against Heat Shock Protein 47 (HSP47) is currently under preclinical studies for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED) associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a host-targeted alloreactive response where immune-mediated phenomenon leads to fibrosis that can take place, for instance, in lacrimal and meibomian glands, ultimately causing a severe decrease in tear production and evaporation. Activated fibroblasts involved in these processes are positives for HSP47 and known to store vitamin A. In a mouse model of chronic GVHD, ocular topical instillation of this HSP47-siRNA encapsulated in Vitamin A-coupled liposomes significantly reduced lacrimal gland fibrosis and collagen deposit, and succeeded in significantly increasing tear secretion. In this model, vitamin A helps to deliver the siRNA into the fibroblasts and is an instrument in the efficient silencing of HSP47 after treatment with one daily administration. Interestingly, no further beneficial effects were seen with twice daily instillation instead of one, suggesting that a single dose per day is sufficient to reach silencing of the target gene.

<span style=color:blue>类似的策略正在被探索，以扩展纳米颗粒在眼表面疾病局部治疗中的应用，如通过简单的眼药水滴注。例如，一种新的针对热休克蛋白47（HSP47）的siRNA目前正在进行临床前研究，用于治疗与慢性移植物抗宿主病（GVHD）相关的干眼症（DED）。GVHD是一种宿主靶向的同种反应，免疫介导的现象导致纤维化，可能发生在如泪腺和睑板腺等腺体中，最终导致泪液分泌减少和蒸发增加。参与这些过程的活化成纤维细胞对HSP47呈阳性，并已知能够储存维生素A。在慢性GVHD的小鼠模型中，眼部局部滴注装载HSP47-siRNA的维生素A偶联脂质体显著减少了泪腺纤维化和胶原沉积，并成功显著增加了泪液分泌。在该模型中，维生素A有助于将siRNA送入成纤维细胞，并在每日一次的治疗后有效地沉默HSP47。有趣的是，改为每日两次滴注并未观察到更多的益处，这表明每天一次的剂量就足以实现目标基因的沉默。</span>

Another interesting development is the use of a transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) siRNA for the treatment of corneal burn. Here, TGF-β1 siRNA was loaded into polymeric nanoparticles and shown to prevent corneal fibrosis and angiogenesis when applied topically in mice that had been subjected to alkaline corneal burn. This wound healing effect was superior to the one produced by the conventional therapy (betamethasone). More recently, siRNAs complexed with optimized liposomes have been designed for the treatment of ocular keratitis caused by *Acanthamoeba*, a group of protozoa that predominantly affect contact lens users. Encapsulation of two siRNAs directed against serine phosphatase and glycogen phosphatase mRNA of this organism into PEGylated cationic liposomes allowed enhanced ability to reduce corneal damage in mice when co-administered with chlorhexidine, the reference treatment. This study provided a new proof of concept for the use of siRNA to treat ocular surface infection.

<span style=color:blue>另一个引人注目的进展是利用转化生长因子β1（TGF-β1）siRNA治疗角膜烧伤的研究。将TGF-β1 siRNA装载入聚合物纳米颗粒后，局部应用于施加碱性角膜烧伤的小鼠，能够有效防止角膜纤维化和血管生成，且疗效优于传统治疗（倍他米松）。近年来，已开发出与优化脂质体复合的siRNA，用于治疗由*阿米巴变形虫*引起的角膜炎，这些变形虫主要感染隐形眼镜佩戴者。通过将两种针对该病原的丝氨酸磷酸酶和糖原磷酸酶mRNA的siRNA封装入PEG化阳离子脂质体中，并与参考药物氯己定联合使用，能够显著减少小鼠角膜损伤。这项研究为通过siRNA治疗眼表面感染提供了新的理论依据。</span>

Peptide-based strategies are also being investigated for the treatment of ocular diseases. A novel method using cationic cell-penetrating peptides that non-covalently bind siRNA has been tested for the delivery of siRNAs to the cornea after topical administration. These peptides can form nanoparticles when mixed with siRNAs in aqueous solution; the encapsulated siRNA, when administered topically in mice along with a nontoxic analog of chloroquine (an endosome disruptor), was shown to produce a 30% decrease of target gene expression in the corneal epithelium. In an analogous mechanistic approach, optimized lipid peptide-siRNA nanoparticles with different surface properties (including PEGylation) have been produced in an attempt to silence the gene coding for Myocardin-Related Transcription Factor (MRTF). Subconjunctival administration of these MRTF-B lipid-peptide nanoparticles into a rabbit model of glaucoma filtration surgery induced a 30% reduction of *MRTF-B* gene expression that was associated with improvement in bleb morphology.

<span style=color:blue>在肽类治疗策略方面，也正在进行研究，尤其是通过阳离子细胞穿透肽递送siRNA。使用这种肽类非共价结合siRNA的方法，已被验证能在局部给药后将siRNA有效传递至角膜。这些肽在与siRNA混合后可形成纳米颗粒，封装的siRNA与氯喹无毒类似物共同使用时，可以在小鼠角膜上皮中减少30%的靶基因表达。此外，已开发出优化的脂质肽-siRNA纳米颗粒，具有不同的表面性质（如PEG化），用于沉默编码心肌转录因子相关转录因子（MRTF）基因。局部注射这些MRTF-B脂质肽纳米颗粒到兔子青光眼滤过手术模型中，结果MRTF-B基因表达减少了30%，且滤泡形态得到了改善。</span>

On the whole, lipid-based nanoparticles have been demonstrated to provide sustained delivery of siRNAs to eye structures, as shown by tissue localization experiments, silencing ability or therapeutic benefits. Moreover, preclinical studies conducted on nanoparticles demonstrated good general safety profile, consistent with their biocompatibility and biodegradable nature. Nonetheless, special care should be taken in terms of safety assessment (biodistribution, tolerability, and elimination) to meet regulatory requirements. While cyclosporine nanomicelle ophthalmic formulation received approval by the FDA, similar strategies for the delivery of siRNA have not yet translated into clinical practice.

<span style=color:blue>总的来说，脂质基纳米颗粒已被证明能持续有效地将siRNA输送至眼部结构，并通过组织定位、沉默基因或治疗效果等方式证明了其效果。此外，临床前研究表明，这些纳米颗粒具有良好的安全性，符合生物兼容性和可降解性要求。但在进行安全性评估时，必须特别注意其生物分布、耐受性及清除等方面，以确保符合监管要求。尽管环孢素纳米胶束眼用制剂已获得FDA批准，但目前类似的siRNA递送策略尚未进入临床实践。</span>

## 5 Quantitation and Biodistribution of siRNAs in the Eye siRNA在眼部的定量与生物分布

During the process of drug development, and in order to meet the standards set by regulatory agencies, an accurate description of the pharmacokinetic profile of therapeutic oligonucleotides requires several complementary techniques. To this end, sensitive analytical methods are now available for their quantitation in biological samples and can be applied to studies on siRNAs intended for the treatment of ocular diseases. However, there still remain numerous technical hurdles to overcome with respect to ocular biodistribution of siRNAs and its impact on their pharmacokinetics.

<span style=color:blue>在药物开发过程中，为了满足监管机构的要求，准确描述治疗性寡核苷酸的药代动力学特征需要借助多种互补技术。如今，已有灵敏的分析方法可用于在生物样本中对siRNA进行定量，并应用于眼科疾病治疗中的siRNA研究。然而，关于siRNA的眼部生物分布及其对药代动力学的影响，仍然面临诸多技术性挑战。</span>

Measuring plasma levels and assessing tissue distribution of newly developed drugs are part of regulatory requirements. Concerning siRNAs developed for the treatment of ocular diseases, this evaluation is simplified as the medication is delivered locally to the eye via eye drops or IVT injection; this results in a marginal systemic exposure to the drug. It is critically important to determine whether the product reaches the target structures within the eye itself, and at which concentrations: ocular biodistribution studies of siRNA are thus needed in order to fully understand their pharmacokinetic properties.

<span style=color:blue>测定血浆中的药物浓度和评估药物在组织中的分布是药物监管要求的常规步骤。对于眼科疾病治疗用siRNA来说，评估过程有所简化，因为药物通常通过眼药水或玻璃体内注射直接递送到眼部，系统性暴露较小。关键问题在于确认药物是否能有效到达眼内的目标组织，并且达到合适的浓度。因此，siRNA在眼部的生物分布研究是必要的，才能全面了解其药代动力学特性。</span>

The most frequently used analytical methods to quantify siRNA that can meet regulatory requirements are the followings: liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), ligand binding assay (LBA hybridization ELISA), reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and anion exchange liquid chromatography (AEX-HPLC) with fluorescence detection (DNA- or PNA-probe HPLC Assay). In the evaluation of pharmacokinetics , a strategy combining two or more complementary techniques is needed to circumvent problems with stability (e.g., effect of RNases), sensitivity (e.g., low recovery of analyte at the extraction step; low accumulating tissue) and specificity (e.g., study of metabolites). Bioanalytical methods for the measurement of plasma concentrations must be validated as per regulatory requirements; for the measurement of tissue concentrations, the methods could be fully validated or qualified (including minimum critical characteristics).

<span style=color:blue>目前，符合监管要求的定量siRNA分析方法包括液相色谱-质谱联用（LC-MS/MS）、配体结合分析（LBA杂交ELISA）、逆转录定量PCR（RT-qPCR）以及带荧光检测的阴离子交换液相色谱（AEX-HPLC）（DNA或PNA探针HPLC测定）。在药代动力学评估中，需要结合两种或多种互补技术，以克服稳定性（如RNase的影响）、灵敏度（如提取过程中低回收率；组织积累较低）和特异性（如代谢物研究）等问题。对于血浆浓度的测量，生物分析方法必须符合监管要求并经过验证；而对于组织浓度的测定，相关方法可以进行完整验证或确认（包括最小关键特征）。</span>

Ocular biodistribution studies entail several bioanalytical challenges. Drug concentrations can cover a wide range depending on the tissue or fluid analyzed and the chemical formulation of the siRNAs: for example, lacrimal glands can accumulate high concentrations of a given compounds while the retina could retain much lower levels. Where needed, different quantitation techniques ought to be used to cover the different concentration ranges observed in eye structures. Because the siRNA pathway operates in the cytoplasm, developing a method for the quantitation of both intra- and extracellular levels of siRNA is desirable as it can provide important pharmacokinetic and biodistribution parameters.

<span style=color:blue>眼部生物分布研究面临许多生物分析的挑战。药物浓度的范围可能因所分析的组织或液体以及siRNA的化学配方而大不相同。例如，泪腺可能会积累较高浓度的某些化合物，而视网膜则可能保持较低的浓度。在实际操作中，必须根据眼部不同组织中的浓度范围，采用多种定量技术来进行研究。由于siRNA的作用途径在细胞质内，因此开发一种能够定量细胞内和细胞外siRNA水平的方法至关重要，这可以为研究提供有价值的药代动力学和生物分布数据。</span>

The biodistribution of siRNAs greatly depends on the delivery route and the chemical characteristics of the molecule. Unmodified naked siRNAs are excellent substrates for RNAses in blood and extracellular space; upon systemic injection, their rapid degradation precludes their distribution to the eye. As seen previously, chemical modification and the use of carriers are two examples of techniques that successfully allowed the preparation of more stable siRNAs. Modified siRNAs can be more stable and could target systemic organs depending on their plasma stability. They will mainly be found in the kidney and liver where they are cleared and excreted. If siRNAs are encapsulated in a delivery agent, their biodistribution will depend on the characteristics of this agent.

### 5.1 Differential Quantitation of Extra- and Intracellular Antisense Strands 差异化定量细胞内外反义链

An (AEX)-HPLC method coupled to fluorescence detection can be used to specifically quantitate both the non-phosphorylated antisense strand and the intracellular 5′-phosphorylated antisense strand of an siRNA. Moreover, the extent of phosphorylation of the antisense strand by polynucleotide kinase 1 is taken as an indicator of the intracellular delivery of the investigational compound. In brief, this bioanalytical method involves the hybridization of a fluorescent labeled probe (complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA) to a test biological sample, followed by fluorescence analysis. The technique was applied to the quantitation of bamosiran in tissues after topical ocular instillation in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. Bamosiran is a naked siRNA that inhibits the synthesis of β2-Adrenergic Receptor (ADRB2) protein to decrease intra-ocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. In this protocol, the probe was a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) strand complementary to the antisense strand of bamosiran. After the specific hybridization step, a first analysis using AEX-HPLC was performed, and the fraction containing the duplexes (probe/bamosiran and probe/(5′-phosphate) bamosiran) was finally separated on a Dionex DNA Pac PA200 column, improving the corresponding chromatographic method. Peak areas of the duplexes were evaluated against an external calibration curve using serial dilutions of bamosiran. The results of this ocular biodistribution study demonstrated that bamosiran was detectable after instillation of a single dose, with the cornea containing the highest concentration of the antisense strand. In the iris and ciliary body, the concentration was about 20% of that found in the cornea, indicating that the compound quickly enters these eye structures. The intact strand was also present in lacrimal glands, although at a lower level. Interestingly, the highest concentration of (5-phosphate) bamosiran was found in the ciliary body, with lower levels in the cornea, iris and lacrimal glands. Overall, the results obtained using the bioanalytical technique described above gave credence to the possible therapeutic potential of the naked unmodified siRNA by demonstrating that locally instilled bamosiran can reach structures of the anterior segment of the eye, be internalized by the cells and phosphorylated at its 5′end. Most importantly, in efficacy models, treatment of NZW rabbits with one drop of bamosiran (20 nmol/day) during 4 days produced a 40% decrease in mRNA levels of ADRB2, which was accompanied by a 20% reduction in IOP.

<span style=color:blue>结合荧光检测的AEX-HPLC方法可用于特异性定量siRNA的非磷酸化反义链和细胞内5′-磷酸化反义链。此外，反义链通过多核苷酸激酶1的磷酸化程度，可作为评估研究化合物细胞内递送的指示剂。简而言之，该生物分析方法包括将荧光标记探针（与siRNA的反义链互补）与测试样本杂交，并进行荧光分析。该技术已应用于定量巴莫西兰（bamosiran）在新西兰白兔（NZW）眼部局部滴注后组织中的分布。巴莫西兰是一种裸siRNA，能够抑制β2-肾上腺素受体（ADRB2）蛋白的合成，从而降低青光眼的眼内压（IOP）。在此方案中，探针为与巴莫西兰反义链互补的肽核酸（PNA）链。特异性杂交步骤完成后，使用AEX-HPLC进行首次分析，接着使用Dionex DNA Pac PA200柱分离包含双链（探针/巴莫西兰和探针/(5′-磷酸)巴莫西兰）的组分，从而优化了色谱方法。通过巴莫西兰系列稀释液外部校准曲线，评估双链峰面积。眼部生物分布研究结果表明，在一次滴注后，巴莫西兰可以被检测到，且角膜中反义链浓度最高。在虹膜和睫状体中的浓度约为角膜的20%，表明巴莫西兰迅速进入这些眼部结构。完整链也存在于泪腺，但浓度较低。有趣的是，(5′-磷酸)巴莫西兰的最高浓度出现在睫状体，其次是角膜、虹膜和泪腺中的浓度较低。总体而言，使用上述生物分析方法得到的结果验证了裸siRNA的潜在治疗能力，表明局部滴注巴莫西兰能够到达眼前段结构，进入细胞并在5′端磷酸化。最重要的是，在效能模型中，NZW兔子接受每天一次的巴莫西兰滴眼（20 nmol/天），持续4天，ADRB2的mRNA水平降低了40%，眼内压降低了20%。</span>

IVT injection has been frequently used to deliver siRNAs to the posterior segment of the eye and this way increases their concentration in eye structures such as the retina. This approach was used by Dejneka et al. who reported on the distribution of bevasiranib, an siRNA targeting VEGF-A (Table 1), following a single IVT injection in rabbit eyes. Tritium-labeled bevasiranib (tracer used for injection) was detected in several structures, but the highest concentration was found in the vitreous humor, whose concentration steadily decreased over time. In contrast, the concentration in the other ocular tissues increased to reach a maximum within 72 h.

<span style=color:blue>IVT注射常用于将siRNA递送到眼睛的后段，从而增加其在视网膜等眼部结构中的浓度。Dejneka等人采用了这种方法，并报告了单次IVT注射后bevasiranib（一种靶向VEGF-A的siRNA，见表1）在兔眼中的分布。使用氚标记的bevasiranib作为示踪剂进行注射后，发现该物质在多个眼部结构中都有检测，但玻璃体中浓度最高，并且其浓度随时间逐渐下降。与此相反，其他眼部组织的浓度逐步增加，并在72小时内达到了最大值。</span>

The development of highly sensitive methods that utilize hybridization with specific probes allowed for the detection and quantification of minimal amounts siRNAs in tissues (in the μg/mL to ng/mL range). These techniques validate the application of RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of ocular diseases; indeed, active forms of siRNAs can be retrieved and precisely quantitated in different ocular structures after eye drop instillation or IVT injection. In ophthalmology, assessment of siRNAs in target and key remote tissues are requirements from regulatory agencies due to the impact on safety and efficacy parameters.

<span style=color:blue>随着利用特定探针杂交技术的高度敏感方法的开发，能够在组织中检测和定量极少量的siRNA（浓度范围从μg/mL到ng/mL）。这些技术证明了RNAi疗法用于治疗眼部疾病的潜力；事实上，活性形式的siRNA能够在眼药水滴注或IVT注射后，从眼部的不同结构中提取并精确定量。在眼科领域，监管机构要求对siRNA在靶向组织及关键远端组织的分布进行评估，因为这直接影响到治疗的安全性和效果。</span>

## 6 Safety of siRNA After Ocular Administration 眼部给药后siRNA的安全性

By definition, siRNAs are chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, and they are considered as New Chemical Entities (NCEs) by Regulatory Authorities, hence pharmacology and toxicology assessment should be carried out following guidelines for NCEs. Features such as target, indication, chemical modifications, and systemic bioavailability of the RNAi-based drugs may influence the nature of the required studies.

<span style=color:blue>siRNA是化学合成的寡核苷酸，被监管机构视为新化学实体（NCEs），因此需要按照NCEs的相关指南进行药理学和毒理学评估。RNAi药物的特性，如靶向、适应症、化学修饰和系统生物利用度，会影响所需研究的类型。</span>

Before first-in-human trials, drugs must demonstrate that their safety profile is acceptable in their intended indication. The general nonclinical safety guidelines require that their safety profile be evaluated in two relevant animal species, usually a rodent and a non-rodent, at three dose levels using the intended clinical route of administration and for a duration that should be similar or superior to that of the clinical trial to be carried out. Nevertheless, ICH S6 guideline states that studies should be carried out in relevant species only. This assessment should include acute or maximum tolerated dose toxicology studies and repeated-dose toxicity studies. The evaluation of systemic toxicity in at least one species is carried out by intravenous injection to maximize systemic exposure; it is generally expected before human studies can begin. Additionally, pharmacokinetics, safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and specific toxicology studies are usually required. The general rules apply to siRNAs, but a case-by-case approach should be followed for each product, and the required studies should be discussed with the competent authorities due to the unique features of these compounds.

<span style=color:blue>在进行首次人体试验之前，药物必须证明其在预期适应症中的安全性是可接受的。一般的非临床安全性指南要求在两种相关的动物物种中进行安全性评估，通常是啮齿类动物和非啮齿类动物，使用预期的临床给药途径，且研究的持续时间应与临床试验时间相当或更长。然而，国际会议（ICH）S6指南指出，研究应仅限于相关物种。评估应包括急性毒性或最大耐受剂量的毒理学研究和重复剂量的毒性研究。通常通过静脉注射在至少一种物种中进行系统毒性评估，以最大化全身暴露，这是人体试验之前必需的步骤。此外，还应进行药代动力学、安全性药理学、基因毒性、致癌性及特定毒理学研究。虽然这些通用规则适用于siRNA，但每种产品应根据具体情况采取个案分析，所需的研究应与相关主管部门讨论，考虑到这些化合物的独特性。</span>

The toxicity of siRNAs upon ocular administration depends mostly on their biodistribution and biological activity. It can be determined by sequence-dependent phenomena such as siRNA hybridization in 5′-UTR regions of unintended targets and sequence-dependent activation through TLRs and RIG-I/MDA5 activation that trigger innate immunity. Likewise, toxicity can be caused by sequence-independent phenomena, such as saturation of the RISC machinery by overdose, which can lead to miRNA dysregulation and significant toxic effects. Other toxic effects are also related to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and complement activation; it is akin to a general toxicity potential related to the chemical structure of NCEs. The information generated in the safety studies in animals must be completed with the safety information obtained from clinical trials and pharmacovigilance.

<span style=color:blue>siRNA在眼部给药后的毒性主要与其生物分布和生物活性有关。其毒性可以通过一些序列依赖性现象来识别，如siRNA在非目标的5′-UTR区域的杂交，或者通过TLR和RIG-I/MDA5的激活来引发先天免疫反应。同样，毒性还可能是由非序列依赖性现象引起的，例如过量导致RISC机制的饱和，进而引起miRNA失调和显著的毒性效应。其他毒性效应还与部分凝血酶原时间（aPTT）和补体激活相关，这类似于与NCE化学结构相关的一般毒性潜力。动物实验中获得的安全性数据，必须结合临床试验和药物监测所得到的安全性信息进行补充。</span>

siRNAs are species specific; hence the species selected for safety assessment should carry a similar target sequence within the gene destined to be silenced. Sometimes, one or two mismatches (differences in nucleotides) to the human sequence will not reduce their activity, depending on the position that would be affected in the siRNA. In these cases, proper justification requires specific silencing studies to be carried out in the selected animal species. Bearing this in mind, selecting the appropriate species for safety studies on siRNAs closely follows the same general rules as for other ocular products. Here, the rat remains the preferred rodent species. However, ocular toxicity and pharmacokinetics studies often benefit from the use of common animal models in this particular field such as rabbit, dog, and monkey. A nonpigmented rabbit strain such as the NZW is usually acceptable when combined with a pigmented species (dog or primate). There is growing incentive for the use of pigmented rabbits, such as the Dutch-Belted (DB), and they are indicated when the drug is expected to bind ocular melanin.

<span style=color:blue>siRNA是物种特异性的，因此在进行安全性评估时，所选的动物物种应与目标基因中要沉默的序列相似。有时，人类基因序列和动物物种之间可能存在一两个核苷酸的差异，但这些差异不一定会降低siRNA的活性，具体取决于siRNA受影响的序列位置。对于这种情况，需要在选定的动物物种中进行特定的沉默实验来进行合理的解释。因此，选择合适的物种进行siRNA的安全性研究，遵循与其他眼部药物类似的基本规则。大鼠仍然是常用的啮齿类动物物种，但眼部毒性和药代动力学研究通常会使用一些常见的动物模型，如兔子、狗和猴子。像新西兰白兔（NZW）这种无色素兔常常与色素动物（如狗或灵长类动物）共同使用。而随着对色素兔需求的增加，荷兰带状（DB）兔等品种逐渐被采用，尤其在药物预计与眼部黑色素结合时，它们的使用具有重要意义。</span>

Over the last decade, several siRNAs intended for ocular conditions have been tested in humans (Table 1), the first ones being bevasiranib followed shortly by sirna-027 which target VEGFA and VEGFR1, respectively. Both drugs were intravitreally administered to treat wet macular degeneration. The frequency and severity of reported systemic and ocular adverse events (AE) for bevasiranib as well as sirna-027 were not different from their respective comparators (IVT monoclonal antibodies). In both studies, most of the AEs were associated to the IVT injection procedure itself (e.g., retinal or conjunctival hemorrhage, vitreous detachment, cataract). While the two compounds themselves showed good safety profiles, their clinical trials were terminated in Phase 3 or 2 because of failure to meet primary efficacy endpoint.

<span style=color:blue>在过去十年里，几种针对眼部疾病的siRNA已经开始在人体中进行临床试验（见表1）。其中最早的是bevasiranib，接着是sirna-027，分别靶向VEGFA和VEGFR1。两种药物都通过玻璃体注射的方式用于治疗湿性黄斑变性。bevasiranib和sirna-027在系统性和眼部不良事件（AE）的发生频率和严重性上，并未与同类药物（IVT单克隆抗体）表现出显著差异。在这两项研究中，大多数不良事件与玻璃体注射过程本身相关（例如，视网膜或结膜出血、玻璃体脱落、白内障）。尽管这两种药物的安全性都很好，但由于未能达成主要疗效目标，它们的临床试验在II期或III期时被终止。</span>

Other siRNAs currently under clinical development by Sylentis for the treatment of eye diseases are bamosiran (indicated for glaucoma) and tivanisiran (indicated for dry eye disease). These drugs are administered as eye drops and have shown excellent tolerability in animal and human studies. During the nonclinical toxicology program of bamosiran, no drug-related ocular alterations or clinical signs were reported. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that the systemic concentration of the drug remained below the lower limit of detection at all time-points or doses tested, thus minimizing the possibility of systemic AEs. In Phase I study, no drug-related AEs were reported, neither locally nor systemically, regardless of the dose and administration schedule. Moreover, bamosiran was not detected in plasma samples at any time point. In Phase II studies, no serious AEs were reported and no differences in rate of AE occurrence were found between treatment arms and/or vehicle group. Similar findings were made during the preclinical and clinical developments of tivanisiran, indicating that both of these siRNAs, administered as eye drops, share an excellent safety profile.

<span style=color:blue>目前，Sylentis公司正在临床开发的其他siRNA药物包括用于治疗青光眼的bamosiran和用于治疗干眼症的tivanisiran。这些药物通过眼药水给药，并在动物和人体研究中显示出良好的耐受性。在bamosiran的非临床毒理学研究中，未发现与药物相关的眼部变化或临床症状。药代动力学分析显示，在所有测试的时间点和剂量下，药物的系统浓度都低于检测限，从而最大程度地减少了系统性不良事件的可能性。在I期临床试验中，无论剂量或给药方案如何，均未报告与药物相关的任何局部或系统性不良事件。此外，bamosiran在任何时间点都未在血浆样本中被检测到。在II期研究中，没有报告严重的AE，并且在治疗组与对照组之间，AE发生率没有显著差异。类似的结果也出现在tivanisiran的临床前和临床研究中，进一步证明这两种以眼药水形式给药的siRNA药物具有极好的安全性。</span>

To date, no siRNA has yet been approved for the treatment of ocular diseases . As for other types of indications, Alnylam developed two siRNAs that have been approved in several countries. The first one, patisiran, is encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles for delivery directed to the liver. Although the main side effects reported for Onpattro were infusion-related reactions, ocular safety was specially monitored during clinical development program. Firstly, amyloid deposition in ocular structures frequently results in complications such as vitreous opacity, vision impairment, dry eye, or glaucoma . The second reason is intrinsically related to serum TTR function. Serum wild-type TTR acts as a carrier of retinol binding protein (RBP) that facilitates transport of vitamin A (retinol) in the blood. Patisiran reduces both wild-type and mutant TTR as it targets a genetically conserved sequence in the untranslated region of both mutant and wild-type TTR mRNA. Inevitably, patisiran silencing results in reduced serum levels of both RBP and vitamin A, which are essential for rod and cone photoreceptors. Although no evidence of ocular vitamin A deficiency was found during the clinical development program of patisiran, both FDA and EMA agreed to include a warning in patisiran’s leaflet stating that vitamin A levels below the inferior limit of normal should be corrected with oral supplementation. Referral for ophthalmological assessment is also recommended if patients develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency, including reduced night vision or night blindness, persistent dry eyes, eye inflammation or corneal thickening, among others. The second approved siRNA, givosiran, is administered via subcutaneous injection once monthly; the most frequent (>25%) side effects are nausea and reactions at the site of injection.

<span style=color:blue>迄今为止，没有siRNA被批准用于治疗眼科疾病。与其他类型的适应症一样，Alnylam公司开发的两种siRNA已在多个国家获得批准。第一种是patisiran，它通过脂质纳米颗粒封装并递送到肝脏。尽管Onpattro的主要副作用是与输液过程相关的反应，但眼部安全性在其临床开发过程中受到特别关注。首先，眼部结构中的淀粉样蛋白沉积常常导致眼部并发症，如玻璃体混浊、视力受损、干眼症或青光眼。其次，血清TTR的功能本身与眼部安全性密切相关。血清中的野生型TTR作为视黄醇结合蛋白（RBP）的载体，帮助将维生素A（视黄醇）运输至血液。patisiran通过靶向野生型和突变型TTR mRNA的保守序列，减少了这两者的含量。结果，patisiran的作用会导致血清中RBP和维生素A的水平下降，而维生素A对视网膜的杆状和锥状光感受器非常重要。尽管patisiran的临床开发过程中未发现眼部维生素A缺乏的证据，但FDA和EMA均同意在patisiran的说明书中添加警告，指示维生素A水平低于正常下限时应通过口服补充剂加以纠正。若患者出现维生素A缺乏相关的眼部症状（如夜间视力下降、夜盲症、持续干眼症、眼部炎症或角膜增厚等），建议转诊至眼科进行评估。第二种已获批准的siRNA是givosiran，每月皮下注射一次，最常见的副作用（>25%）为恶心和注射部位反应。</span>

There are several additional siRNA-based drugs in late stage of development that are expected to obtain approval in the near future; this should generate additional safety data most useful for the design of innocuous delivery system of siRNA. So far, the AEs reported upon ocular and systemic treatments with siRNA relate more to the mode of administration rather than to specific properties of siRNAs.

<span style=color:blue>此外，还有几种基于siRNA的药物正在开发的后期，预计将在不久的将来获得批准。这些药物将为siRNA的递送系统设计提供更多有用的安全性数据。目前，关于siRNA眼科和全身治疗的副作用报告，更多的是与给药方式有关，而非siRNA的特定性质。</span>

## 7 Current Status of Ocular siRNA Candidates 眼用siRNA候选化合物的现状

Since the introduction of RNAi in the field of ophthalmology, a growing number of candidates have reached preclinical and clinical development stages for the treatment of ocular diseases. This last section documents the status of ocular siRNAs and a detailed list is presented in Table 1.

<span style=color:blue>自从RNA干扰技术（RNAi）被引入眼科领域以来，越来越多的候选药物进入了治疗眼科疾病的临床前和临床开发阶段。本节介绍了眼科siRNA候选药物的现状，并提供了详细的清单（见表1）。</span>

For a time, most of the efforts in siRNA development were concentrated on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) , the leading cause of vision loss in developed countries. The wet form of the disease (wAMD) is characterized the abnormal growth of fragile blood vessels emanating from the subjacent choroid and invading the RPE and the subretinal space. These newly formed vessels have an increased likelihood to leak blood and serum causing disruption of retinal structures and triggering degenerative changes involving cell loss, eventual fibrosis, and scar tissue formation. This process, also known as CNV, is mediated by VEGF. The first-ever clinical trial with an siRNA was conducted in 2004. Bevasiranib (Cand5), a naked unmodified compound developed by Acuity Pharmaceuticals and later by Opko Health, was rationally designed to target VEGF mRNA. Phase I study was conducted in patients with active CNV associated with wAMD. Single IVT injections of ascending doses of bevasiranib were administered to obtain preliminary tolerability and efficacy data. In 2005, bevasiranib was advanced into Phase II to test safety and efficacy of the compound for an extended treatment period .

<span style=color:blue>最初，siRNA开发的重点大多集中在与年龄相关的黄斑变性（AMD）治疗上，该疾病是发达国家视力丧失的主要原因。该病的湿性类型（wAMD）特征是来自脉络膜的脆弱血管异常生长，侵入视网膜色素上皮（RPE）及视网膜下腔。这些新生血管容易渗漏血液和血清，导致视网膜结构的破坏，并引发包括细胞丧失、最终纤维化和疤痕组织形成等退行性变化。此过程也被称为脉络膜新生血管（CNV），其介导因子是血管内皮生长因子（VEGF）。第一个临床试验于2004年开展，使用了由Acuity Pharmaceuticals开发的未修饰的裸siRNA化合物bevasiranib（Cand5），该化合物被合理设计为靶向VEGF mRNA。第一阶段研究在患有wAMD相关活跃CNV的患者中进行。通过单次IVT注射递增剂量的bevasiranib，以获取初步的耐受性和疗效数据。2005年，bevasiranib进入第二阶段研究，旨在评估该化合物在长期治疗中的安全性和疗效。</span>

Almost simultaneously, the clinical development of AGN211745 , previously known as Sirna-027, was initiated by Allergan and Sirna Therapeutics. The compound is an unmodified naked siRNA designed to target VEGFR1 mRNA in patients with CNV secondary to AMD . A Phase I clinical trial was started in 2004 to study safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and dose-limiting toxicity of single IVT injection of AGN211745. Results showed that single IVT ascending doses of AGN211745 were well tolerated, while visual acuity and foveal thickness stabilized or improved. At that time, bevasiranib was already at a Phase III study (COBALT) to determine the effect on visual acuity and the optimum dose-regimen of ITV injections as maintenance therapy for AMD patients previously treated with Lucentis® (ranibizumab). Similarly, AGN21745 was moved into Phase II to assess the effect of different dose-levels on visual acuity as compared to ranibizumab. In 2009, both clinical trials were terminated not for safety reasons, but for not achieving improved efficacy over ranibizumab, the reference treatment.

<span style=color:blue>几乎同时，AGN211745（以前称为Sirna-027）的临床开发由Allergan和Sirna Therapeutics开始。这一化合物是一个未修饰的裸siRNA，旨在靶向VEGFR1 mRNA，用于治疗由AMD引起的CNV。2004年启动了Phase I临床试验，研究单次IVT注射AGN211745的安全性、耐受性、药代动力学和剂量限制毒性。结果显示，AGN211745的单次IVT递增剂量耐受良好，同时视觉敏锐度和黄斑厚度稳定或改善。此时，bevasiranib已经进入了Phase III研究（COBALT），评估IVT注射对视力敏锐度的影响及其在先前接受Lucentis®（雷珠单抗）治疗的AMD患者中的维持治疗最佳剂量方案。同样，AGN21745也进入了Phase II研究，评估不同剂量水平对比ranibizumab（雷珠单抗）对视觉敏锐度的影响。2009年，这两项临床试验因未能证明其相较于雷珠单抗的疗效提高而终止，而非因安全性问题。</span>

Research on RNAi therapeutics for retinal disorders was resumed by Quark Pharmaceuticals with PF-655, a 19-nt 2′O-methyl-stabilized siRNA targeting RTP801, which was later fully licensed to Pfizer. RTP801 is a stress-induced adaptor protein that inhibits mTOR function and whose expression is rapidly upregulated in response to ischemia, hypoxia and/or oxidative stress. IVT injection of PF-655 in preclinical animal models of laser-induced CNV led to inhibition of RTP801 independently of TLR activation, expression of anti-angiogenic and neurotrophic factors, and subsequent reduction of CNV volume, vessel leakage and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the choroid.

<span style=color:blue>Quark Pharmaceuticals重新启动了针对视网膜疾病的RNA干扰（RNAi）疗法研究，采用了PF-655，这是一种19个核苷酸长的2′O-甲基稳定化siRNA，针对RTP801，后来将其完全授权给辉瑞。RTP801是一种应激诱导的适配蛋白，抑制mTOR功能，且在缺血、低氧和/或氧化应激等条件下迅速上调。在激光诱导的CNV（脉络膜新生血管）临床前动物模型中，PF-655的IVT注射能够独立抑制RTP801，且不依赖于TLR激活，增强了抗血管生成及神经营养因子的表达，并有效减小了CNV体积，减少了血管渗漏和炎症细胞向脉络膜的浸润。</span>

PF-655 was studied in a Phase I and in one Phase II study (MONET) for the treatment of wAMD. MONET trial showed that PF-655 produced increasing improvements in mean visual acuity over the first 3-month period and that the combination with ranibizumab was more efficient than ranibizumab in monotherapy. Additionally, PF-655 was studied in two Phase II clinical trials (DEGAS and MATISSE) for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), a complication of diabetic retinopathy. DEGAS study showed that treatment with PF-655 over a period of 12 months caused a dose-dependent improvement in visual acuity when compared to patients treated with laser photocoagulation. Despite initial promising results, very little information regarding PF-655 can be found after MATISSE study completion in 2014.

<span style=color:blue>PF-655曾在一项I期和一项II期临床试验（MONET）中用于治疗湿性年龄相关黄斑变性（wAMD）。MONET试验结果表明，在前三个月内，PF-655显著提高了平均视力，且与ranibizumab联合使用的效果优于单独使用ranibizumab。此外，PF-655还在两项II期临床试验（DEGAS和MATISSE）中用于治疗糖尿病性黄斑水肿（DME），该病是糖尿病视网膜病变的并发症。DEGAS研究显示，PF-655治疗12个月后，相较于激光光凝治疗的患者，其视力表现出了剂量依赖性的改善。尽管最初的结果相当乐观，但自2014年MATISSE试验结束后，关于PF-655的进一步信息极为稀少。</span>

The same company has another compound, QPI-1007 undergoing clinical trials. This siRNA was designed to block the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein caspase 2, thus inhibiting apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells and preventing vision loss in patients suffering from NAION. QPI-1007 (IVT injection) has been studied for this indication in a Phase I clinical trial, which showed good tolerance, and in Phase II/III trial that was terminated early since interim analysis did not warrant enrolment. QPI-1007 is also under earlier stages of development for the treatment of acute primary closed angle glaucoma, a disease that also leads to blindness through damage of the optic nerve, in this case as a consequence of elevated IOP.

<span style=color:blue>同一公司还在临床试验中使用QPI-1007这款化合物。这种siRNA设计用于抑制促凋亡蛋白caspase 2的表达，从而阻止视网膜神经节细胞的凋亡，避免非动脉炎性视神经病变（NAION）患者发生视力丧失。QPI-1007（IVT注射）在I期临床试验中显示了良好的耐受性，并在II/III期临床试验中因中期分析结果不支持继续招募而提前终止。QPI-1007还在早期阶段进行开发，旨在治疗急性原发性闭角型青光眼，这种疾病也会因视神经损伤而导致失明，通常是由于眼内压（IOP）升高引起的。</span>

Bamosiran , formerly known as SYL040012, is a canonical siRNA targeting ADRB2 which is being developed by Sylentis for the treatment of ocular hypertension and open angle glaucoma. Glaucoma is a group of ocular pathologies characterized by optic nerve damage as a consequence of sustained IOP above physiological limits. Commercially available ocular beta blockers are able to effectively reduce IOP by intercepting aqueous humor secretion pathways; however, cardiovascular and respiratory side effects are frequently reported as these molecules reach bloodstream when topically administered in the eye. One of the major advantages of bamosiran is its limited systemic bioavailability, thus minimizing the possibility of systemic adverse effects. This was confirmed in the PK analysis performed in healthy volunteers and patients during Phase I studies. Subsequently, a 14-day dose-finding placebo-controlled and a 28-day active-controlled (SYLTAG) trial were carried out. Results showed that bamosiran was able to efficiently reduce IOP; however, superiority versus timolol was not achieved. Good local and systemic tolerability was observed in all clinical trials conducted with bamosiran.

<span style=color:blue>Bamosiran（前称SYL040012）是一种靶向ADRB2的经典siRNA，由Sylentis公司开发，旨在治疗眼压升高和开角型青光眼。青光眼是一类眼部疾病，特征是由于眼内压持续超出生理范围，导致视神经受损。市面上的β受体拮抗剂能够通过抑制房水分泌有效降低IOP，但由于这些药物通过眼部滴眼进入血液，常常会出现心血管和呼吸系统的副作用。Bamosiran的主要优势在于其低系统性生物利用度，从而有效减少了全身性副作用的风险。通过在健康志愿者和患者中的药代动力学（PK）分析已证实这一点。随后的14天剂量寻找安慰剂对照试验和28天活性对照试验（SYLTAG）结果表明，Bamosiran能够有效降低IOP，尽管未能表现出优于噻吗洛尔的效果。在所有进行的临床试验中，Bamosiran展现了良好的局部和全身耐受性。</span>

Sylentis is also responsible for the development of tivanisiran (SYL1001), a naked 19-nt siRNA-targeting transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) ; it is administered in eye drops for Dry Eye Disease (DED). DED is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface whose most common signs and symptoms are burning, itching, redness, dryness, pain and photophobia. TRPV1 represents an attractive target for reducing signs and symptoms of DED due to its dual function in corneal tissues: (1) it participates in ocular pain sensing, transmission and regulation, (2) it acts as a mediator of innate inflammatory response.

<span style=color:blue>Sylentis还在开发tivanisiran（SYL1001），一种裸露的19个核苷酸长的siRNA，靶向瞬时受体电位香草素-1（TRPV1），并作为眼药水用于治疗干眼症（DED）。干眼症是一种由多种因素引起的眼表疾病，最常见的症状包括灼烧感、瘙痒、红眼、干涩、疼痛和畏光。由于TRPV1在角膜组织中具有双重作用，使其成为缓解干眼症症状的理想靶点：（1）参与眼部疼痛的感知、传导和调节，（2）作为先天性免疫反应的介质。</span>

Local and systemic tolerability results of Phase I clinical trial fostered tivanisiran into Phase II clinical trials. Two placebo-controlled dose-finding studies were conducted to determine the effect of four different doses of tivanisiran (10 days of treatment) in patients with mild to moderate ocular pain associated to DED. The dose showing the highest improvement in pain scores (symptom) and corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) was selected to initiate a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial (HELIX). Results showed improvement in central CFS when compared to placebo. Although no statistical significance was achieved for ocular symptoms, *post-ho*c analysis suggested a higher effect for tivanisiran in the most severely affected patients. The effect of tivanisiran on DED subpopulations will be further explored in subsequent clinical trials.

<span style=color:blue>基于I期临床试验中的局部和系统耐受性数据，tivanisiran进入了II期临床试验。进行了两项安慰剂对照的剂量寻找试验，评估了四种不同剂量的tivanisiran（为期10天）在轻至中度眼部疼痛患者中的疗效。选择了能显著改善疼痛评分和角膜荧光素染色（CFS）的剂量，启动了安慰剂对照的III期试验（HELIX）。结果显示，与安慰剂组相比，中央CFS有所改善。尽管眼部症状未达到统计学显著性，*事后分析*表明，tivanisiran在最严重的患者中效果更佳。tivanisiran对干眼症不同亚群体的疗效将在后续临床试验中进一步探索。</span>

The eye has become the center of activity of several R&D programs. Companies such as OliXPharmaceuticals are exploring new modalities of siRNAs with enhanced RNAi triggering properties. Their proprietary technology of cell-penetrating asymmetric siRNAs (cp-asiRNAs) allows efficient internalization without delivery vehicles. OliX Pharmaceuticals partnered with Théa to foster the development of its leading candidate, OLX301A, for the treatment of both dry and wet AMD. Other candidates for the treatment of ocular pathologies, such as OLX301D for subretinal fibrosis, OLX301J for AMD, and OLX304A for retinitis pigmentosa are in preclinical stages.

Sylentis is finalizing the launch of SYL1801 into Phase I clinical trials. This candidate is a modified siRNA inhibitor of Notch-Regulated Ankyrin Repeat Protein (NRARP), a key regulator of CNV. All available therapies for this disease are injected by the intravitreal route whereas SYL1801 is formulated as eye drops. Nonclinical biodistribution studies proved SYL1801 bioavailability in the retina after administration in eye drops. Additionally, SYL1801 eye drops significantly reduced areas of neovascularization in the retina of a rat model of LASER-induced CNV.

<span style=color:blue>Sylentis正在完成将SYL1801推向I期临床试验的准备工作。这一候选药物是针对Notch调控的Ankyrin重复蛋白（NRARP）的改良siRNA抑制剂，NRARP在脉络膜新生血管（CNV）形成中起关键作用。现有治疗方法需要通过玻璃体内注射，而SYL1801则通过眼药水形式给药。非临床研究显示，SYL1801眼药水能够在滴眼后有效进入视网膜并发挥生物利用度。此外，在激光诱导CNV的大鼠模型中，SYL1801眼药水显著减少了视网膜的新生血管区域。</span>

## 8 Conclusion

The approval of patisiran and givosiran, together with the number of promising siRNA candidates in advanced clinical stages, is a most encouraging achievement that will undoubtedly stimulate the emergence of new siRNA-based therapeutics in the coming years, especially we hope for ophthalmic indications. More so, the eye is an organ endowed, like no other, with major advantages for the use of siRNAs: (i) accessibility, allowing for straight on-site delivery; (ii) isolation, minimizing systemic dispersion and off-site adverse effects; (iii) immune-privileged environment, limiting immune-related ocular toxicities; and (iv) low RNase content, enhancing local bioavailability and dose-level optimization. Moreover, innovative nucleotide designing and delivery systems of siRNAs focused on particular ocular tissues, should open up new avenues for the treatment of eye disorders.

<span style=color:blue>patisiran和givosiran的获批，再加上许多有前景的siRNA候选药物进入临床晚期，标志着一项令人振奋的成就，毫无疑问，这将为未来几年新型siRNA治疗药物的问世提供动力，特别是在眼科领域。更重要的是，眼睛作为一个器官，具有其他器官所不具备的独特优势，使其成为siRNA治疗的理想选择：（i）良好的可接近性，便于直接现场给药；（ii）天然的隔离性，减少药物在全身的扩散和外部不良反应；（iii）免疫特权环境，减轻免疫相关眼部毒性；（iv）较低的RNase含量，提高局部生物利用度并有助于剂量水平优化。此外，针对特定眼部组织的创新核苷酸设计和siRNA给药系统，将为眼科疾病的治疗开辟新的可能性。</span>
