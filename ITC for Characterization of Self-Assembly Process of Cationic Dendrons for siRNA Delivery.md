## Abstract

siRNAs are emerging as promising therapeutic agents due to their ability to inhibit specific genes in many diseases. However, these tools require specific vehicles in order to be safely delivered to the targeted site. Among different siRNA delivery systems, self-assembled nanomicelles based on amphiphilic cationic dendrons (ACDs) have recently outperformed nanovectors based on covalent carriers. This chapter describes how isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) can be exploited as one of the best techniques to investigate the self-assembly process of ACDs. Specifically, ITC can provide, as such or via specific analysis methods, a full thermodynamic characterization of these nanomicelles, including their critical micellar concentration, micelle aggregation number, degree of counterion binding, Gibbs free energy of micellization, and its enthalpic and entropic components.

## 1 Introduction

RNA interference (RNAi) is the biological mechanism by which a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces gene silencing by leading to the ultimate degradation of a complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. Its discovery started a revolution in the therapeutic treatment of several diseases and transformed the way researchers study gene functions and their effects on various molecular pathways. RNAi is linked to numerous vital processes such as cell growth, tissue differentiation, heterochromatin formation, and cell proliferation. Conversely, RNAi dysfunction is linked to cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and many types of cancer. Undeniably, increasing knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of endogenous RNAi showed how small (or short) interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have a potential as novel nucleic acid-based therapeutics for the treatment of several incurable human pathologies.

However, since naked exogenous siRNAs are rapidly identified and degraded by systemic nucleases when administered into the circulatory system, they must be administered to cells by using efficient delivery systems in order to achieve potent gene silencing effects. These carriers usually compact the nucleic acid fragments into small supramolecular complexes which prevent degradation and promote cellular uptake. Delivery nanosystems are usually classified as viral and nonviral vectors. In the field of synthetic nanocarriers, cationic lipids or polymers are the most widely employed. Among the latter, amphiphilic cationic dendrons (ACDs) based on polyamidoamine (PAMAM) branches are a relatively new class of very promising siRNAs nanocarriers . In particular, PAMAM-based ACDs are able to self-organize into spherical nanosized micelles and to efficiently interact with siRNAs as they appropriately combine the hydrophobic properties of lipid vectors with the unique binding capability of PAMAM dendrimer carries. In this regard, the recently developed ACD1, featuring a single C-18 alkyl chain as the apolar portion and a PAMAM head bearing 8 primary amines as terminal groups (Fig.1), represents a remarkable example. Indeed, ACD1 is able to effectively deliver siRNA sequences directed against the mRNA coding for the heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27, a small molecular chaperone which is a vital regulator of cell survival and a major player in drug resistance) both in vitro and in vivo, and to produce significant gene silencing with a consequent potent anticancer activity.

Atoms are depicted as sphere colored by element (carbon, gray; hydrogen, white; oxygen, red; nitrogen, blue). The van der Waals surface of the micelle is also shown (light cyan). Only polar hydrogens are shown for clarity

For the development of new and more efficient ACD-based siRNA nanocarriers, a thorough understanding of the relevant self-assembling process is crucial, since specific characteristics of nanomicelle formation may have different effects on their siRNA transport/release properties and, ultimately, on their biological activity. In this regard, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is an ideal experimental technique to investigate any biomolecular interaction including, among others, ligand-receptor binding and aggregation phenomena, since it allows to determine the whole process thermodynamics.

Accordingly, this chapter is focused on how to obtain fundamental micellization parameters such as the associated enthalpy (*ΔH*~mic~) and the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Notably, CMC is a very important quantity representing a phase separation between ACD monomers and aggregates in dynamic equilibrium; it is defined as the concentration of ACD molecules above which they aggregate into micelles . Next, the derivation of other important micellization factors like the micelle aggregation number (*N*~agg~) and degree of counterion binding (*β*) through ITC experiments is reported. Finally, the estimation of the Gibbs free energy of micellization (*ΔG*~mic~) and its related entropy contribution (*TΔS*~mic~) is also presented to complete the calorimetric analysis.

### 1.1 ITC Instrumentation and General Principles

An ITC instrument basically consists of two identical coin-shaped cells—the sample and reference cells, respectively—enclosed in an adiabatic shield (jacket), as shown in Fig. 2. During a typical ITC experiment (e.g., receptor-ligand binding), the reference cell is filled with solvent (e.g., buffer water), the sample cell is loaded with the receptor solution, and both cells are heated and maintained rigorously at the same temperature by a highly sensitive thermocouple. The ligand (titrant) solution is then automatically and stepwise injected into the sample cell through a syringe whose needle also works as a stirrer to ensure appropriate mixing (Fig. 2). The use of ITC relies on the evidence that any (bio)molecular interaction is accompanied by heat absorption (endothermic process)/release (exothermic process). At each single titrant injection, the technique then monitors this heat change by determining the differential power (expressed in μcal/sec or μJ/sec) required for counteracting any temperature difference between sample and reference cells and restoring the heat-flux to baseline (Fig. 2). Toward the end of the titration, the heat signal becomes very low since the receptor is saturated by the ligand and only background heat due to unspecific phenomena (i.e., ligand dilution or liquid friction) is observed. The final thermogram is obtained by recording all signals generated during each injection, while the integration of the area under each signal provides the enthalpy heat associated with the specific interaction.

### 1.2 ITC for Micellization Study

In a typical ITC experiment for studying self-assembly phenomena, an aqueous or buffered suspension of the amphiphilic molecules under investigation at a concentration well above their CMC is titrated into the sample cell filled only with the same solvent. Therefore, ITC truly investigates a demicellization process (i.e., the opposite of micelle formation) and actually reports the corresponding demicellization enthalpy (*ΔH*~demic~). However, since enthalpy is a state function and self-assembly is reversible, the following relationship can be applied:

$$ \varDelta {H}_{\mathrm{demic}}=-\varDelta {H}_{\mathrm{mic}} $$

Accordingly, in what follows we will always refer to the micellization enthalpy (*ΔH*~mic~).

The ITC thermogram of a demicellization process is characterized by three distinct phases (Fig. [3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)): (i) during the initial steps, after each injection the corresponding concentration of amphiphilic molecules in the sample cell is below the relevant CMC; therefore, micelles dissociate into monomers and the heat of monomer dilution is recorded; (ii) in the central stages of the titration, the concentration of the amphiphiles in the sample cell progressively increases until it reaches the CMC value, at which micelles begin to form; (iii) finally, once the self-assembly process is finished, only the micelle dilution heat is monitored upon further amphiphilic monomer addition.

**Fig. 3** Schematic illustration of micellization events during an ITC experiment

ITC raw data (Fig. 4a) must next be integrated (Fig.4b) and then commonly fitted by apt thermodynamic models. Two of these—both assuming that only two species (monomers and micelles) are found throughout the entire process—are most commonly adopted, namely the pseudo-phase separation model (PPM) and the mass-action model (MAM). The PPM model demonstrated some caveats in the description of the micellization process of micelles with low aggregation number since it does not explicitly consider the structure and size of the micellar system . On the other hand, the MAM assumes an existing equilibrium between free amphiphilic monomers and their micelles at CMC, and it can work even for self-assembled system with low aggregation number. Additionally, it also accounts for micelle-bound counterions, the effect of which is extremely important when ionic amphiphiles are studied. Since in the remaining part of this chapter the self-assembly process of the cationic amphiphile ACD1 is selected by way of example, the corresponding ITC data will be elaborated by exploiting the latter model (MAM).

## 3 Methods

This chapter describes a complete ITC procedure to investigate the self-assembly process of a generic amphiphilic cationic dendron (ACD). Despite it refers to the specific PAMAM derivative ACD1, the exploited methods and the described characterizations can be applied also to other different ACDs through opportune adaptations listed in the Subheading [4](## 4).

### 3.1 Sample Preparation

1. Prepare and purify ACD1 following the synthetic route described by Yu et al. in the Supporting Information of the paper and freely available at this link: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201203920](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201203920). 
2. Weigh the appropriate amount of ACD1 powder and add the corresponding volume of ultrapure water in order to reach the final concentration of the desired stock solution (*see* **Note** **2**), in this case equal to 1.5 mM. 
3. Sonicate the stock solution for 30 min and keep it for 2 h at room temperature to achieve complete micelle formation. 

### 3.2 Checking of Micelle Formation by DLS

Dynamic Light Scattering allows to obtain information about micelle morphology and dimensions in terms of their hydrodynamic diameter (*D*h) and polydispersity index (PDI, i.e., the particle size distribution). In other words, DLS is a quick and useful technique to verify a successful aggregation process.

1. Dilute the stock solution of ACD1 (*see* Subheading 3.1) by adding ultrapure water to reach a final concentration of 1 mM. 
2. Stir the sample solutions thoroughly to ensure proper mixing and dissolution. 
3. Carry out DLS measurement at 25 °C, with a He-Ne ion laser operating at a wavelength of 633 nm. 
4. Ensure that the obtained value of Dh is around 7 nm with a very low PDI value as reported in [[13](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#CR13)]. 

### 3.3 ITC Protocol

1. In an Eppendorf tube dilute the ACD1 stock solution (*see* Subheading [3.1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec6)) to the appropriate concentration of 150 μM (*see* **Note** [**3**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec16)) and with this new solution then fill the ITC titration syringe. 
2. Make sure that both sample cell and syringe have been scrupulously cleaned since their previous use. A wash cycle is highly recommended before any new series of experiments, which is an easy task since the most modern calorimeters have built-in automated washing routine (*see* **Note** [**4**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec16)). 
3. Fill the sample cell with 208 μL of ultrapure water. To perform this operation with the MicroCal PEAQ-ITC, load at least 300 μL of ultrapure water in the long-needle syringe provided with the instrument to specifically perform this operation. Slowly insert the long-needle syringe into the sample cell port, softly touch the cell bottom, and gradually lift the syringe up as filling proceeds. In order to avoid the formation of or to remove eventual air bubbles, which will disturb ITC runs, while retracting the long-needle syringe contextually aspire a small volume of solution and dispense this once syringe lift is complete. 
4. Set measurement temperature at 25 °C (*see* **Note** [**5**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec16)). 
5. Set an optimal injection sequence in terms of number of injections, volume, and time interval between injections (*see* **Note** [**6**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec16)). For this example, set the total number of injections to 37, the injection volume to 1 μL, and the injection spacing time to 240 s. 
6. Set the syringe concentration to 150 μM. 
7. Set the sample cell concentration to 0 μM. 
8. Set the reference power to 10 μcal/s (*see* **Note** [**7**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec16)). 
9. Set the stirring speed to 600 rpm. It is important to ensure a good mixing during all the titration procedure; however, this value can be fine-tuned according to the sample viscosity, stability, and tendency to generate foam. 
10. Set the initial delay (i.e., the lag time between signal recording and first injection) to 240 s, in order to establish a baseline and to assess its stability prior to the first injection. 
11. Set feedback mode to high (*see* **Note** [**8**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec16)). 
12. Run the experiment. Once the instrument reaches the equilibrium value for operative parameters such as cell temperature and DP baseline, the titration automatically starts reporting in real-time the DP signal over the course of the all injections. 
13. Once the ITC experiment is completed, reference and sample cells along with the titration syringe must be cleaned. For the reported protocol, a default cleaning method is easily performed using the software’s guided workflow (*see* **Note** [**9**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec16)). 

### 3.4 ITC Data Analysis

#### 3.4.1 Raw Data Inspection and Optimization

1. Inspect the obtained raw thermogram and check for any abnormality ascribable to technical or sample-related problems. 

2. Use the software provided by the manufacturer for baseline correction and data integration (*see* **Note** [**10**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec16)).

   Figure [4a](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4) shows the dilution thermogram of ACD1 micelles in ultrapure water solution as obtained by applying the above protocol. In this panel, the three sequential phases of the underlying phenomena described at Subheading [1.2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec3) are well evident. Specifically, at the beginning of the experiment each injection of the concentrated ACD1 solution into the sample cell mostly results in large, exothermic signals corresponding to micelle dilution, micelle dissociation into ACD1 monomers, and monomer dilution . If more solution containing ACD1 micelles is added to the sample cell, a clear decrease in the heat is observed indicating that the added micelles no longer dissociate within the sample cell. In the final part of the thermogram, the further addition of a concentrated ACD1 micellar solution leads to heat effects due just to micellar dilution, a the ACD1 concentration in the sample cell well above the corresponding CMC.

   In order to perform the correct integration of the heat raw data: 

3. Exclude the first injection (*see* **Note** [**11**](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec16)). 

4. Subtract the unspecific heats derived from the titration of two ultrapure water solution without ACD1 . The integrated data yield the observed heat Q as a function of ACD1 concentration, as shown in Fig. [4b](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4). 

#### 3.4.2 CMC Determination and *ΔH*mic Calculation

Generally, the micellization curve assumes a sigmoidal profile like the one shown in Fig. [4b](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4). Accordingly, although the software packages of most commercial ITC instruments have built-in data analysis and fitting routines, it is important to have at least a basic understanding of the equations used and of the relevant underlying assumptions. Hence, data processing programs (e.g., GraphPad Prism) allowing linear and nonlinear fitting are required for this kind of analysis. Consequently:

1. Export the integrated data into a GraphPad sheet. 

2. Apply the Boltzmann Sigmoidal fitting to obtain the fitted curve as shown in Fig. 5a. 

3. Calculate the first derivative of the Q vs. C fitting curve (Fig. 5a) for a more precise determination of the midpoint of the micellization process (although the CMC can be also defined as the midpoint of the Q vs. C curve). 

4. Find the maximum of the derivative curve and mark the corresponding value on the x-axis. As highlighted by the red arrow in Fig. 5a this corresponds to a final CMC value of 11.2 μM.

   From the ITC titration curve, the micellization enthalpy (*ΔH*~mic~) can also be directly calculated as the heat difference between the two extrapolated lower and upper curve plateaus of the curve, as shown in Fig. 5b.

   The total enthalpy observed during the entire process (*ΔH*obs) further includes the contribution due to ACD1 monomers (*ΔH*~mon,dil~) and micelle dilution (*ΔH*~mic~~,dil~):

   $$ {\varDelta H}_{\mathrm{mic}}={\varDelta H}_{\mathrm{obs}}-\left({\varDelta H}_{\mathrm{mon},\mathrm{dil}}+{\varDelta H}_{\mathrm{mic},\mathrm{dil}}\right) $$    (1)

   To solve Eq. (1): 

5. Read *ΔH*~obs~ value as the difference between the observed heat at the beginning of the titration and the observed heat at the end of the titration. 

6. Calculate the *ΔH*~mon,dil~ as the difference between the observed heat at the beginning of the titration and the heat at the end of the first, lower sigmoidal plateau (*see* **Note** **12**). 

7. Calculate the *ΔH*~mic,dil~ through the difference between the observed heat at the end of the titration and the heat at the beginning of the second, higher sigmoidal plateau (*see* **Note** **12**).

The CMC is taken as the x-value at the minimum of dQ/dC curve (indicated by the red arrow). (**b**) Determination of the *ΔH*mic obtained from the integrated ITC data

For ACD1 molecules, the resulted values are the following: *ΔH*~mic,dil~ = 18.67 kcal/mol; 

*ΔH*~mic,dil~ = −0.042 kcal/mol; and 

*ΔH*~mic,dil~ = −0.353 kcal/mol.

#### 3.4.3 CMC Value Validation by Pyrene Assay

In order to validate CMC values obtained with ITC experiments, there are several alternative techniques that can be used. One of the most exploited is the pyrene assay, in which the CMC is estimated by fluorescence measurement using pyrene as a fluorescent probe. When micelles are formed, pyrene is preferentially incorporated into the hydrophobic micelle core instead of the polar environment (aqueous solution). The decrease in the intensity ratio (I373/I384) of pyrene in the excitation spectra indicates the onset of micellization process of the amphiphilic molecule under scrutiny. Accordingly:

1. Prepare a solution in ultrapure water of pyrene at fixed concentration of 0.6 μM. 
2. Prepare 15 different ultrapure water solutions of ACD1 at scalar concentrations from 30 nM to 0.5 mM. 
3. Sonicate the solutions for 30 min and keep them for 2 h at room temperature to finalize micelle formation. 
4. Record fluorescence excitation spectra (300–360 nm) of each solution at an emission wavelength of 335 nm, with the excitation and emission bandwidths set at 5 nm slit width. 
5. Analyze the pyrene fluorescent intensity ratio of I~373~/I~384~ and plot it as a function of the logarithm of ACD1 concentration, as shown in Fig. 6. 
6. Determine the CMC^pyr^ value in the corresponding I~373~/I~384~ plots as the interception point between the nearly horizontal part at high pyrene concentrations and the fast variable part (*see* Fig. 6).

**Fig. 6** The critical micelle concentration of ACD1 determined using the fluorescent dye pyrene at pH 7.4

In the present example, the extrapolated CMC^pyr^, corresponding to a value of 9.96 μM, confirms the quality of the calorimetric approach to determine the critical micelle concentration for ACD1.

#### 3.4.4 Estimation of the Micelle Aggregation Number (*N*~agg~)

Once the CMC values have been determined, the micelle aggregation number (*N*~agg~) can give important information concerning the number of monomer present in the aggregate system. Specifically, *N*~agg~ has been defined as average number of monomers in a spherical micelle that are well characterized by the two-state reaction model for which:

$$ {N}_{\mathrm{agg}}\ast S\leftrightarrow {\mathrm{MIC}}_{N_{\mathrm{agg}}} $$    (2)

where *S* corresponds to the monomeric form of the amphiphilic molecules and $$ {\mathrm{MIC}}_{N_{\mathrm{agg}}} $$ corresponds to its fully n-meric state.

By applying the analysis method described by Olesen et al.(*see* **Note** **13**), *N*~agg~ can be derived by regression analysis of the normalized ITC integrated data collected in Subheading [3.4.1](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec10) through the following equation:

$$ \frac{\mathrm{dln}\left({\left(\frac{d\left[\mathrm{ACD}1\right]}{d\mathrm{ACD}{1}_{\mathrm{TOT}}}\right)}^{-1}-1\right)}{\mathrm{dln}\left[\mathrm{ACD}{1}_{\mathrm{TOT}}\right]}=\frac{N_{\mathrm{agg}}-1}{N_{\mathrm{agg}}}+\frac{{\left({N}_{\mathrm{agg}}-1\right)}^2}{N_{\mathrm{agg}}}\ \frac{d\left[\mathrm{ACD}1\right]}{d\left[\mathrm{ACD}{1}_{\mathrm{TOT}}\right]} $$    (3)

In Eq. ([3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Equ3)), [ACD1] is the concentration of the ACD1 molecules in their monomeric state and [ACD1]TOT corresponds to the total concentration of amphiphilic cationic dendron in the sample cell during the ITC experiment. From the principle of mass conservation:

$$ \left[\mathrm{ACD}{1}_{\mathrm{TOT}}\right]=\left[\mathrm{ACD}1\right]+{N}_{\mathrm{agg}}\ast \left[{\mathrm{MIC}}_{N_{\mathrm{agg}}}\right] $$    (4)

The Sum of Squares due to Regression (SSR) is used to determine how well the predicted data describe the observed data and the *N*~agg~ is chosen as the estimated value with the lowest SSR (*see* **Note** **14**). In the supporting information of the relevant paper, an Excel Binary File (.xls) is available as a template for this kind of data analysis through which additional parameters describing micellization process can also be obtained. Since our particular interest lies exclusively in the calculation of the *N*~agg~, our research group developed an *in-house* python script (n_agg.py, Table 1, *see* **Note** **15**) by extracting and adapting the part of analysis inherent to this specific parameter.

**Table 1** In-house developed python script for the calculation of the *N*~agg~ parameter

![485053_1_En_15_Tab1_HTML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zcgkiller/Pictures/main/Wechat/485053_1_En_15_Tab1_HTML.png)

Accordingly, in order to obtain *N*~agg~ from the ITC data, the underlying procedure has to be followed:

1. Prepare the input file for the script (*see* the corresponding example in Table 2) as a XY table in which the first column is filled with the ITC integrated heats expressed in cal/mol and the second column corresponds to the ACD1 concentration in the sample cell at each injection expressed in millimolar units. Call this text file as *nagg_input.txt*. 

2. Convert the value of *ΔH*~mic~, *ΔH*~mon,dil~, and *ΔH*~mic,dil~ as acquired in the Subheading [3.4.2](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec11) in cal/mol units, and assign these values to the script required parameters *dH-mic*, *mon-dH-dil*, and *mic-dH-dil*, respectively.

    

3. Execute the n_agg.py script in a linux shell by issuing the following command:

   ```python
   ./n_agg_mod.py --exp-data nagg_input.txt --dH-mic 18670 --mon-dH-dil -42 -mic-dH-dil -35
   ```


4. Read the calculated *N*~agg~ value and the related SSR from the terminal line as shown in Fig.7. For the ACD1 example, *N*~agg~ = 10.07.

#### 3.4.5 Calculation of the Degree of Counterion Binding (*β*)

For ionic micelles in solution the effect of counterion condensation has to be taken into consideration since the terminal group residing on the micellar outer surface are typically fully ionized; such high charge density usually results in the adsorption of counterions from the bulk solvent onto the micellar surface itself. The degree of counterion binding β of any ionic micelle can be determined by using the Corrin-Harkins equation:

$$ \ln \mathrm{CMC}=-\beta \ast \ln \left[{X}^{-}\right]+K $$    (5)

in which [*X*^−^] represents the total concentration of the counterions in the solution and *K* is a constant related to the free energy of micellization. Accordingly, to obtain the *β* value from ITC experiments just follow the protocol below:

1. Repeat the procedure described in Subheading [3.3](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_15_Chapter.xhtml#Sec8) yet this time starting from stock solutions of ACD1 prepared in the presence of 2.5 μM, 5.0 μM, 7.5 μM, and 10 μM NaCl, respectively. 

2. Plot the logarithm of the CMC values determined at different counterion concentrations against the logarithm of counterion concentration, as shown in Fig. 8. 

3. Calculate the degree of counterion binding β as the slope of the data linear regression (red line in Fig. 8). The resulting β value for ACD1 corresponds to 0.65.

#### 3.4.6 Calculation of the Gibbs Free Energy of Micellization (*ΔG*~mic~) and Its Entropic Contribution (*TΔS*~mic~)

The procedure described so far allows to finally obtain the two remaining quantities required to fully describe the thermodynamics of the micellization process, i.e., the Gibbs free energy of micellization (*ΔG*~mic~) and its entropic component (*TΔS*~mic~) . Indeed, by using the refined mass-action law model for ionic micelles, *ΔG*~mic~ can be derived from the corresponding CMC, *N*~agg~ and β values by applying the following equation:

$$ {\varDelta G}_{\mathrm{mic}}=-\frac{\mathrm{RT}}{N_{\mathrm{agg}}}\ \ln \left(\frac{1}{{\left(\mathrm{CMC}\right)}^{\beta {N}_{\mathrm{agg}}}}\ast \frac{N_{\mathrm{agg}}-2}{{N_{\mathrm{agg}}}^2\left(2{N}_{\mathrm{agg}}-1\right)}\ast {\left(\mathrm{CMC}\ast \frac{{N_{\mathrm{agg}}}^2-{N}_{\mathrm{agg}}}{{N_{\mathrm{agg}}}^2-2}\right)}^{1-{N}_{\mathrm{agg}}}\right) $$    (6)

while *TΔS*~mic~ can be derived using the fundamental Gibbs equation:

$$ {T\varDelta S}_{\mathrm{mic}}={\varDelta H}_{\mathrm{mic}}-{\varDelta G}_{\mathrm{mic}} $$    (7)

Accordingly, for the ACD1 micelles the calculated values of these two thermodynamic quantities are −10.17 kcal/mol for *ΔG*~mic~ and 28.84 kcal/mol for *TΔS*~mic~, respectively.

The full data set obtained from the ITC characterization of ACD1 self-assembly are listed in Table3.

## 4 Notes

1. Different types of buffers can be used (PBS, HEPES, etc.) as ITC is compatible with all aqueous buffers in a range of pH 2–12. However, it is important to note that the buffers must ensure solubility and stability of the molecular entities under investigation. Contextually, they must not interfere with the analyzed phenomena by adding other positive or negative heat effects, *e.g*., specific buffer ionization enthalpies. They can also include different salts, cofactors, and additives that might be necessary to achieve good solubilization of the self-assembling molecules. The final, critical requirement is that the buffers in the sample cell and in the titration syringe are identical, otherwise the total heat measured might account for undesired contributions due to buffer mixing and dilution effects. 

2. Calculate the amount of dendrimer and weigh on an analytical balance. Since ACDs are charged molecules, some issues and errors during the weighting process might occur. Thus, for good quality weighing results and in order to prevent errors due to static charges it is recommended to make a 10 X stock solution of your titrant dendrons. For this purpose, weigh an amount of the dendron in a test tube and calculate the volume of the buffer necessary to reach a 10 X concentration as compared to the working solution. 

3. For the best fitting purposes, ideally the CMC value should be reached at the midpoint of the ITC titration in order to have an optimal data point distribution along the sigmoidal profile. Thus, the initial concentration of the amphiphilic molecules should be calculated after preliminary optimization experiments or by prior CMC estimation by other experimental techniques. 

4. For a good maintenance of the instrument it is highly recommendable to perform water-in-water titration in order to verify whether both the syringe and the sample cell are properly cleaned. If the washing procedure has been correctly performed, the heat peaks recorded from the water-in-water injections should be small (less than 0.02 μcal) and the DP baseline should be linear. Otherwise, additional cleaning procedure should be performed. 

5. ICT experiment can be carried out in the temperature range of 2–80 °C. However, the use of ITC for micellization process characterization is limited to a range of temperatures in which sigmoidal curves are obtained, that is, in a temperature interval in which the self-assembly process can be related with the release or absorption of a detectable heat. Performing ITC experiments at different temperatures could be exploited to obtain the temperature dependence of the micellization enthalpy (*ΔH*~mic~) and the correlated change in thermal heat capacity (*ΔCp*). 

6. The number of injections required for any given ITC experience is a matter of compromise; indeed, good ITC integrated data fitting requires a high number of titrant injections. On the other hand, this corresponds to a lower volume for each injection and this, in turn, unavoidably leads to smaller (i.e., less detectable) generated heat. Unlike for protein-ligand binding experiments, in ITC-based studies of self-assembly phenomena it is not possible to increase the initial concentration of the titrating molecule in order to proportionally increase the heat signal. In fact, this input parameter is strictly related to the specific CMC value of the amphiphilic molecule (*see* **Note** **3**). 

7. The reference power range is spread between 10 (better for exothermic phenomena) and 1 (better for endothermic interactions). In the absence of any indication about the sign of *ΔH*~mic~ for the system under consideration, a first preliminary experiment at the value of 5 μcal/s is recommended, eventually followed by a reference power value optimization. 

8. The feedback modes can be set to low or high (active mode) or none (passive mode). For a fast thermal process as micellization, high gain will provide the fastest response time since high sensitivities are not required for these kind of ITC detections. On the other hand, long and slow thermal process (e.g., binding kinetics or metabolic rates) might benefit from using the passive or low gain feedback modes to improve the sensitivity of the instrument. 

9. Common cleaning procedure requires that both sample cell and titration syringe are soaked in a mild detergent for at least 2 h followed by water and methanol rinse to facilitate the drying process. Recommended detergents are 10–20% Contrad™ 70 or 14% Decon™ 90. 

10. For a correct interpretation of ITC data, it is always recommended to visually inspect the instrument raw data. If needed, a manual correction of the baseline can be performed, particularly in those cases where the heat signal is weak and/or the baseline is noisy. In line, also spikes undisputably ascribable to the presence of air or foam bubbles can be excluded as artifacts. 

11. The first injection should be set to a smaller volume compared to the others (e.g., 0.4 μL for an iTC200) and the corresponding peak discarded, since it is usually imprecise. The rationale for this procedure relies on the fact that the heat observed from this first injection is systematically smaller in magnitude than expected. The prevailing explanation is preinjection loss of titrant through diffusive mixing of material near the tip of the syringe with the solution in the reaction vessel. 

12. Generally, dilution heats can be considered constant during the entire ITC experiment. Slight modifications of the linear dependency during the pre- or post-micellar regions do not introduce any significant uncertainty in the estimation of the corresponding *ΔH*~mic~  value. In certain cases, the dilution heats can also be negligible. 

13. As specifically stated in the text, the described methodology has been specifically developed to describe the thermodynamics of the aggregation of nanomicelles with low *N*agg. As such, it aptly performs in concentration ranges centered around the CMC value. Undeniably, it is well established that the use of ITC is not feasible to determine *N*~agg~ at very high concentrations as *N*~agg~ normally increases under such conditions. 

14. For a deeper understanding of the methods, their specific requirements and their limitations, it is strongly advised to consult the original paper by Olesen et al. . 

15. The python script runs on python version 3, and it requires few packages that are standard in the most common python distributions, like *numpy*. The released n_agg.py file works as a *stand-alone* script. A basic knowledge of the python language is suggested for any modification or adaptation of the file.
