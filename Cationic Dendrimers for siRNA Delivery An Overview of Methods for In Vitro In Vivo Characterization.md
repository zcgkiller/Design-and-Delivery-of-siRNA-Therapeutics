## 1 Introduction 引言

Thanks to our deeper understanding of the genetic aberrations involved in many human pathologies, the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics to downregulate or replace mutated genes or to suppress unwanted gene expression is becoming a highly attractive approach in nanomedicine. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) represent a new approach toward the inhibition of gene expression; as such, they have rapidly emerged as promising therapeutics for a plethora of important diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other disorders of a genetic etiology. However, the clinical translation of RNA interference (RNAi) requires safe and efficient vectors for siRNA delivery into cells; the ability of targeting specific cells becomes a key requirement for RNAi-based therapeutics. Indeed, naked siRNAs are not amenable to therapeutic administration, as after intravenous administration these exogenous nucleic acid fragments are either readily digested by nucleases or eliminated from the kidney glomeruli before reaching the disease-afflicted organ. Furthermore, the passage of siRNAs through the cell membrane is difficult to achieve as a result of their large size and polyanionic nature. Although viral vectors are generally very efficient transfecting agents, they raise many biosafety concerns and this, in turn, spurs the search for nonviral (i.e., synthetic) nanovectors (NVs). Among the various nonviral carriers, cationic dendrimer NVs are emerging as the most promising ones, as they are able to generate stable nanoassemblies with siRNA through electrostatic interaction, thereby protecting the nucleic acid fragment from degradation and promoting cellular uptake. So far, a multitude of NVs have been investigated for siRNA delivery, including poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers, poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimers, poly(l-lysine) dendrimers, and carbosilane dendrimers. Structurally, covalent cationic dendrimers (CCDs) share a common molecular skeleton constituted by three distinct domains (Fig. 1): (1) a group of central atoms defined as the core; (2) the branching units defining the dendrimer growth through different generations (Gs); and (3) an exponentially increasing number of positive charged terminal groups. Among CCDs, PAMAM dendrimers undoubtedly constitute the molecules most widely explored as siRNA delivery NVs since they are provided with several beneficial features.

<span style=color:blue>随着我们对人类病理相关基因异常机制的深入认识，利用核酸治疗策略下调或替代突变基因，或抑制有害基因表达，已成为纳米医学中备受瞩目的研究方向。小干扰RNA（siRNA）作为一种新型的基因表达抑制工具，已经在癌症、心血管疾病以及多种遗传病的治疗中展现出巨大潜力。然而，RNA干扰（RNAi）疗法的临床转化需要依赖安全、高效的siRNA递送载体，而实现对特定细胞的靶向递送则是RNAi疗法成功的关键。裸露的siRNA在治疗中面临多种挑战，例如，在静脉注射后易被核酸酶快速降解或通过肾小球清除，难以到达病变部位；同时，其较大分子量和多阴离子性质使其难以通过细胞膜。尽管病毒载体是高效的转染工具，但其潜在的生物安全问题推动了非病毒（合成）纳米载体的开发。在多种非病毒载体中，阳离子树枝状分子因其能够通过静电作用与siRNA形成稳定的纳米复合体，保护siRNA免受降解并促进细胞摄取，而成为极具潜力的候选者。目前，研究者已探索了多种纳米载体用于siRNA递送，包括聚酰胺胺（PAMAM）、聚丙烯亚胺（PPI）、聚L-赖氨酸和碳硅烷树枝状分子等。从结构上看，共价阳离子树枝状分子（CCDs）由三部分构成：（1）核心域；（2）通过代数扩展的分支单元；（3）呈指数增长的正电荷末端基团（如图1所示）。在众多CCDs中，PAMAM树枝状分子因其显著的优势而成为最常用的siRNA递送纳米载体。</span>

**Fig. 1** Cartoon representation of a CCD structure highlighting its three, distinct structural motifs: the core (light blue), the branching units forming the different G generation (spring green), and the cationic terminal groups (dark blue)

One of the main issues concerning CCDs is that only the highest generations (e.g., G ≧ 5) are provided with efficient and effective siRNA transfecting agents. However, synthesizing a large amount of pure, high-G CCDs involves considerable costs, time, and efforts. To overcome this limitation, a new approach has been recently developed based on the exploitation of self-assembly, of a quintessential nanotechnology method. Accordingly, different amphiphilic cationic dendrons (ACDs) have been designed and synthetized. ACDs couple the multivalent cooperativity of highest generations of CCD NVs with the self-assembling property of lipid vectors (Fig. 2).

<span style=color:blue>共价阳离子树枝状分子（CCDs）面临的一个主要挑战在于，只有较高代数（如G ≧ 5）的CCDs才能有效用于siRNA的高效转染。然而，高代数CCDs的合成过程复杂且成本高昂，同时需要耗费大量时间和精力。为了解决这一问题，研究者近期开发了一种新方法，通过利用纳米技术的核心手段——自组装，来优化载体设计。基于此，研究者设计并成功合成了多种两亲性阳离子树枝形分子（ACDs）。这些ACDs将高代数CCDs的多价协同作用与脂质载体的自组装能力相结合，从而实现了功能与结构的优化（如图2所示）。</span>

**Fig. 2** Cartoon representation of an ACD structure. The branching units (spring green) and the cationic terminal groups (dark blue) represent the hydrophilic portion of a CCD structure while the black lines identify its lipophilic moiety

Self-assembly is a process that relies on the cumulative effects of multiple non-covalent interactions to assemble ACD building blocks into supramolecular entities in a reversible, controllable, and specific way. Consequently, ACDs are able to auto-organize themselves into nanosized micelles which, in most instances, outperform their covalent dendrimer counterparts for siRNA delivery purposes.

<span style=color:blue>自组装是一种基于多重非共价相互作用累积效应的过程，通过可逆、可控且特异的机制将ACD分子组装成超分子结构。由此，ACDs能够自发形成纳米级胶束，并且在多数情况下，其siRNA递送效率超过传统的共价树枝状分子（CCDs）。</span>

Both CCDs and ACDs require a variety of adequate experimental techniques for their characterization. Specifically, the complex pathway of a siRNA/NV nanoparticle toward its target cells must be validated in all its steps (Fig. 3): from the characterization of its peculiar properties (I) and the assessment of stability of the intermolecular complex (II) to the siRNA transport across the cell membrane and the delivery of the nucleic acid to its proper location (III) through interactions with the intracellular trafficking machinery. The silencing activity of the siRNA/NV complex must be finally validated at cellular level (IV, in vitro) and then translated to animal models (V, in vivo), again through the exploitation of specific and robust experimental approaches. Lastly, the intrinsic toxicity profile (VI) of the nanocarrier and its complex with siRNA has to be investigated for its eventual therapeutic translation.

<span style=color:blue>在开发CCDs和ACDs时，需要采用多种实验技术对其进行全面表征。siRNA/NV纳米颗粒从制备到实现靶向递送的复杂过程需要逐步验证（图3）。首先是纳米载体的特性分析（I）及其与siRNA复合物的稳定性评估（II）；接下来需确认siRNA如何穿越细胞膜并通过细胞内转运机制精确递送至目标位置（III）。随后，需要在细胞实验（IV，体外）中评估其基因沉默效果，并通过可靠的实验方法将研究成果应用于动物模型（V，体内）。最后，纳米载体及其复合物的潜在毒性（VI）也需要详细研究，以支持其在临床治疗中的应用前景。</span>

## 2 Chemical-Physical Characterization of the Pure NV 纯纳米载体的化学物理表征

For the effective exploitation of RNAi, every siRNA delivery system must be small and stable since small nanoparticulate complexes can penetrate deep into their target tissues. Furthermore, small and stable nanosystems can be efficiently taken up by cells and effectively protect the siRNA against enzyme degradation. Accordingly, experimental techniques that yield information about the morphology and dimensions of the NVs alone assume a pivotal role. Moreover, the knowledge of particle size distribution and polydispersity index (PDI) of cationic NVs is also of outmost importance, as these are two main physicochemical attributes that influence their endocytosis-dependent cellular uptake. In addition, cationic NVs interact with their cargo through ionic bonding that originates at their interface with the oppositely charged nucleic acid fragments. On the other hand, it is known that molecules with high positive charge densities are potentially endowed with elevated toxicity due to their unspecific interaction with cell membranes. Accordingly, the characterization and the eventual subsequent fine-tuning of the charge distribution on a NV surface is of paramount importance to achieve an optimal balance between the required siRNA affinity and a low-toxicity profile.

<span style=color:blue>为了实现RNAi的高效应用，siRNA递送系统需要具备小尺寸和稳定性特性。这是因为小尺寸的纳米颗粒能够深入靶组织，且稳定的纳米系统不仅能被细胞高效摄取，还可以有效保护siRNA免受酶降解。因此，分析纳米载体形态与尺寸的实验方法显得尤为重要。此外，阳离子纳米载体的粒径分布和多分散指数（PDI）是关键物化属性，对内吞介导的细胞摄取过程有重要影响。阳离子纳米载体通过与带负电的核酸片段形成界面离子键，从而完成结合。然而，高正电荷密度可能导致分子与细胞膜的非特异性作用，从而增加毒性。因此，纳米载体表面电荷分布的表征和优化至关重要，以实现siRNA结合亲和力和低毒性之间的最佳平衡。</span>

Finally, in the case of ACD NVs , it is essential to analyze in detail the thermodynamics of their self-aggregation process, and to characterize the stability of the relevant nanoassemblies by deriving fundamental chemical-physical parameters. One of such quantities is the critical micellar concentration (CMC), which is defined as the concentration of ACDs in solution above which ACDs aggregate into micelles.

<span style=color:blue>对于ACD纳米载体，研究其自组装过程的热力学特性以及纳米聚集体的稳定性至关重要。临界胶束浓度（CMC）是衡量其自组装行为的重要参数，定义为ACD在溶液中的浓度高于某一值时开始形成胶束的临界点。</span>

### 2.1 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) 动态光散射

Detection of light scattering from matter is a useful technique with applications in numerous scientific disciplines where, depending on the light source and detector, specific molecular properties can be studied. In a typical DLS experiment, the sample under investigation is exposed to a monochromatic wave of light (typically a laser). Over the course of the analysis, the laser beam, scattered in all directions upon colliding with the particles in solution, is captured by a detector. Accordingly, DLS is widely used for studying the structure and the dimensions of NVs. In general, the technique is best used for submicron particles although in principle it can be used to measure particle with sizes less than a nanometer. In DLS, the time-dependent fluctuations in the scattered light are measured by a fast photon counter. These fluctuations are directly related to the rate of diffusion of the particle through the solvent, which is related in turn to their hydrodynamic radii. The particle diffusion coefficient (*D*) is calculated by fitting the correlation curve to an exponential function, with *D* being proportional to the lifetime of the exponential decay. Once known, *D* is then used to calculate the particle hydrodynamic diameter (*D*<sub>h</sub>) through the Stokes–Einstein equation:

<span style=color:blue>动态光散射（DLS）是一种广泛应用的技术，通过监测光与物质相互作用产生的散射现象，能够研究多种分子特性。在典型的实验中，样品被暴露于单色光（通常为激光）下，激光与溶液中的粒子发生碰撞后产生全方位的散射光，这些光随后由检测器捕获。DLS因其能够有效研究纳米载体（NVs）的结构与尺寸而被广泛使用。通常，该方法适用于亚微米粒子，但理论上可用于测量小于1纳米的粒子。DLS测量的是散射光随时间的波动，这些波动反映了粒子在溶剂中的扩散速率，而扩散速率与粒子的水动力半径密切相关。通过将测得的相关曲线拟合为指数函数，可以计算出粒子的扩散系数(*D*)，扩散系数与指数衰减的寿命成正比。随后，利用斯托克斯-爱因斯坦公式可进一步计算粒子的水动力直径(*D*<sub>h</sub>)。</span>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi>T</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn><mi>&#x3c0;</mi><mi>&#x3b7;</mi><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">h</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

where *k* is the Boltzmann constant, *T* is the temperature, and *η* is the medium viscosity. With small differences, in most cases the hydrodynamic radius (*R*<sub>h</sub> = *D*<sub>h</sub>/2) derived by DLS is comparable with the gyration radius (*R*<sub>g</sub>)—i.e., the average distance of any atom in a molecule from its center of mass—obtainable from other experimental techniques such as small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) . Therefore, both *D*<sub>h</sub> and *R*<sub>g</sub> can provide information about the actual dimensions of a NV.

<span style=color:blue>在公式中，*k*为玻尔兹曼常数，*T*代表温度，*η*表示介质的粘度。通常，动态光散射（DLS）测得的水动力半径（*R*<sub>h</sub> = *D*<sub>h</sub>/2）与其他实验技术（如小角中子散射（SANS）和小角X射线散射（SAXS））得到的回转半径（*R*<sub>g</sub>）差别较小。回转半径描述的是分子中任意原子到其质心的平均距离。因此，无论是*D*<sub>h</sub>还是*R*<sub>g</sub>，都能为纯纳米载体的实际尺寸提供有价值的信息。</span>

In DLS another important output is PDI, a number calculated from a simple two-parameter fit to the correlation data (the cumulants analysis). PDI is dimensionless and describes the broadness of the particle size distribution, ranging from 0 (theoretical) for a perfectly mono-disperse sample to 1 for a sample with a very broad size distribution containing multiple particle sizes. Anyhow, values smaller than 0.05 are rarely seen other than with highly monodisperse standards and values above 0.4 indicate that the sample has a very broad size distribution and is likely not suitable for most applications, nanomedicine in particular.

<span style=color:blue>在动态光散射（DLS）中，多分散指数（PDI）是另一个关键参数，它通过累积分析法对相关数据进行简单的两参数拟合得出。PDI是无量纲的，用于描述样品粒径分布的宽度。理论上，完全单分散样品的PDI为0，而PDI为1的样品则表示粒径分布非常宽，包含多种粒径。实际上，除非是高度单分散的标准样品，PDI小于0.05的情况很少出现；而当PDI超过0.4时，表明样品的粒径分布较为广泛，这通常不适合大多数应用，尤其是在纳米医学领域。</span>

Finally, a further important parameter that can be measured by DLS is zeta-potential (*ζ*). By definition, this quantity provides a measure of the electrostatic potential between the bulk solvent and the stationary layer of fluid attached to a dispersed particle and, as such, is related to the particle surface charge. Many colloidal or other nanoparticle dispersions bear surface charges once in solution. If an electric field ***E*** is applied to these systems, the underlying electrostatic interactions cause the particles to jiggle in a motion whose direction and velocity are governed by the particle charge itself, the nature of the solvent, and the intensity of the applied ***E***. Thus, DLS-based laser Doppler electrophoresis can be employed to measure the small frequency shifts in the scattered light that arise owing to these ***E***-induced particle movements which, in turn, are linked to *ζ* (in mV) via different theoretical expression, the most common being the Smulochowski model.

<span style=color:blue>DLS还可以测量另一个重要参数——zeta电位（*ζ*）。该参数量化了溶剂与附着在分散粒子上的静止液层之间的静电势，因此与粒子的表面电荷相关。许多胶体或纳米粒子在溶液中会带有表面电荷。如果施加电场***E***，静电相互作用会使粒子产生抖动，其运动的方向和速度受到粒子电荷、溶剂性质及施加电场强度的影响。因此，通过DLS激光多普勒电泳技术，可以测量由于电场引起的粒子运动所导致的散射光频率微小变化，这些变化与*ζ*电位（单位：mV）相关，常见的计算模型是Smulochowski模型。</span>

Figure 5a,b illustrates representative examples of NV DLS analysis ; in particular, the PAMAM-ACD-1 nanocarrier is provided with a low PDI value of 0.10 and it predominantly forms nanoparticles around 7.0 nm in size with a positive *ζ*-potential of +35 mV.

### 2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) 透射电镜

Different types of microscopy techniques are used for NVs imaging such as TEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and polarized optical microscopy. In TEM, an electron beam passing through an ultra-thin specimen is absorbed and scattered, producing contrast and an image. Because of the very short wavelength of the electron beam employed, TEM can achieve sub-nanometer resolutions well below that of even the highest-resolution light microscopes (∼20 nm). The general procedure for the preparation of a TEM sample requires the use of an ultramicrotome in order to obtain the thinnest possible sample allowing for effective electron transmission through it. Working with nanoscale materials such as CCDs or ACDs somewhat simplifies this process which, however, remains troublesome and time-consuming. Indeed, dendrimer-based sample preparation for TEM imaging involves the deposition of the material onto extra-thin carbon-coated copper support grids, followed by sample drying in air. The subsequent stage commonly consists in grid staining with heavy metal salt solutions (typically uranyl acetate or lead citrate), a process required in order to enhance the contrast between the nanostructures under observation and the background.

<span style=color:blue>不同类型的显微镜技术被用于纳米载体（NVs）的成像，例如透射电子显微镜（TEM）、原子力显微镜（AFM）和偏振光学显微镜。在TEM中，电子束通过超薄样品时会被吸收和散射，从而产生图像和对比度。由于电子束波长非常短，TEM能够提供比任何光学显微镜更高的分辨率，达到亚纳米级（约20 nm以下）。TEM样品的制备通常需要使用超薄切片机，以便获得尽可能薄的样品，以便电子束能够顺利通过。对于树状大分子材料（如CCDs或ACDs），这一过程有所简化，但仍然相对繁琐且费时。具体而言，样品准备需要将材料沉积在超薄的碳涂层铜支撑网格上，并在空气中干燥。然后，通常需要用重金属盐溶液（如醋酸铀或柠檬酸铅）对网格进行染色，以增强纳米结构与背景之间的对比度。</span>

An example of TEM imaging obtained for cationic dendrimer-based NVs is shown in Fig. 5c: the PAMAM-ACD-1 nanoassemblies appear as white objects on a dark background of the amorphous carbon substrate. If, as in the present case, the visualized nanoobjects are well separated from each other, the measurement of their sizes and their morphology description can easily be accomplished using an image analysis software. In the specific case of PAMAM-ACD-1 NVs, TEM imaging is in agreement with the corresponding DLS data (panels a and b), since it reveals the formation of small spherical particles with sizes in the range of typical micellar nanoobjects (6–7 nm).

<span style=color:blue>图5c展示了通过TEM成像获得的阳离子树状大分子基NVs的示例。PAMAM-ACD-1纳米组装体在无定形碳基底的黑色背景中呈现为白色物体。如果样品中的纳米物体相互分离良好，使用图像分析软件可以轻松地测量其尺寸并描述其形态。对于PAMAM-ACD-1 NVs，TEM成像结果与DLS数据（图a和b）一致，表明其形成了典型胶束纳米物体（6–7 nm）大小的球形粒子。</span>

### 2.3 Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) 等温滴定量热法

Understanding in detail the self-assembling process of ACDs for siRNA delivery is important because the specific micellar phase of a given ACD may influence its biological effects; moreover, the knowledge of the chemical details of these aggregation processes could allow for precise control of siRNA transport. ITC is a reliable, simple, and rapid technique for obtaining the full set of thermodynamic parameters that drive micelle formation and determine the CMC value for any amphiphilic molecule. Although a plethora of different techniques is available to experimentally determine CMC values—ranging from spectroscopic to electrochemical, and optical measurements—only ITC is able, through the determination of the whole thermodynamic process associated with underlying self-assembly phenomenon, to provide information for designing and obtaining more stable and better performing ACD systems. In combination with the structural evidence provided by DLS and TEM, ITC data complete the set of information required for a complete description of ACD NVs micellization. As described in detail below, somewhat counterintuitively ITC experiments describe a demicellization process, which is the reverse phenomenon of the corresponding self-assembly. Accordingly, Fig. 6 shows the demicellization thermogram of the ACD-3 NV in buffer solution as an example. ITC experiments carried out for ACD-3 can be used as prototypical examples of how an ACD micellization process could be described through calorimetric measurements. At the beginning of the titration (Fig. 6b), the injection of a concentrated ACD-3 solution into a buffer solution mostly results in large, endothermic (i.e., positive) signals, followed by a series of very small, exothermic (negative) peaks in the latest stages of the experiment (Fig. 6c). The enthalpy change characterizing the first part of the thermogram corresponds to the progressive addition of a concentrated ACD-3 solution (i.e., *C* > CMC) to the buffer (sample cell), resulting in the subsequent ACD-3 micelle dilution, ACD-3 demicellization, and dilution of the ACD-3 monomers. When more solution of ACD-3 micelles is titrated into the sample cell, a clear decrease in the heat is observed, indicating that the added micelles do no longer dissociate or, in other words, the CMC value is attained. In the final part of the thermogram, further additions of the concentrated ACD-3 micellar solution to the sample cell leads to heat effects due to micellar dilution, being the ACD-3 concentration in the cell well above the corresponding CMC. To obtain the corresponding numerical CMC value, ITC raw data be further elaborated as follows: (1) subtraction of the micelle dilution heat must be performed; (2) data normalization per mol of ACD-3 must be carried out, (3) the resulting heat raw data must be integrated to yield the heat *Q* as a function of the concentration *C* curve shown in Fig. 6b and, finally, (4) the CMC can be estimated as the midpoint of this *Q* vs. *C* curve. However, for a more precise determination of the CMC value, *Q* vs. *C* data can be fitted to a suitable model from which the corresponding first derivative can easily be calculated (*see* Fig. 6d) (both these last two processes can be carried out with simple versatile statistic tools, e.g., GraphPad). Accordingly, the CMC value corresponds to the minimum of this derivative curve, as highlighted by the arrow in Fig. 6d. From the ITC titration curve, the micellization enthalpy (Δ*H*<sub>mic</sub>) is calculated from the enthalpy difference of the two levels of the titration curve as shown in Fig. 6e. The experimental determination of the Δ*H*mic and the CMC values then allows for the calculation of the other thermodynamic parameters. The free energy of micellization (Δ*G*<sub>mic</sub>) can be approximated by the expression Δ*G*<sub>mic</sub> = *RT* ln CMC′, where *R* is the gas constant (8.31e<sup>−3</sup> kJ/mol K) and *T* is the absolute temperature and CMC′ is the critical micellization concentration expressed in its molar units. The change in entropy associated with the micellization (*T*Δ*S*<sub>mic</sub>) can be calculated from the second law of thermodynamics by using the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation *T*Δ*S*mic = Δ*H*<sub>mic</sub> − Δ*G*<sub>mic</sub>. As an example, all the thermodynamic parameters obtained for the micellization of the ACD-3 NV are listed in Fig.6f. As it can be seen, the entropy contribution dominates the micellization process, with the enthalpy playing a minor role (|*T*Δ*S*<sub>mic</sub>| ≫ |Δ*H*<sub>mic</sub>|) and this can be specifically related to the releasing of the water molecules in the hydration shells around the hydrophobic parts of the ACD-3 monomers with the subsequent production of hydrophobic forces.

<span style=color:blue>理解ACDs自组装过程的细节对于siRNA递送非常重要，因为特定的ACD胶束相可能影响其生物学效应；此外，了解这些聚集过程的化学细节可以实现对siRNA运输的精确控制。ITC是一种可靠、简单且快速的技术，用于获取驱动胶束形成并确定任何两性分子CMC值的所有热力学参数。虽然有多种不同的技术可以用来实验性地确定CMC值——从光谱学到电化学，再到光学测量——但只有ITC通过确定与潜在自组装现象相关的整个热力学过程，才能提供用于设计和获得更稳定、更高效ACD系统的信息。结合DLS和TEM提供的结构证据，ITC数据补充了描述ACD NVs胶束化过程所需的完整信息。如下面详细描述的那样，ITC实验描述的是一个去胶束化过程，这是与自组装过程相反的现象。因此，图6显示了ACD-3 NV在缓冲溶液中的去胶束化热图，作为示例。针对ACD-3进行的ITC实验可以作为原型示例，说明如何通过热量测量描述ACD胶束化过程。在滴定的开始（图6b），将浓缩的ACD-3溶液注入缓冲溶液中主要产生较大的吸热（即正）信号，随后在实验的后期（图6c）出现一系列非常小的放热（负）峰。热图的前半部分的焓变对应于浓缩ACD-3溶液的逐步添加（即C > CMC）到缓冲液（样品池），导致随后的ACD-3胶束稀释、ACD-3去胶束化和ACD-3单体的稀释。当更多的ACD-3胶束溶液被滴定到样品池时，观察到热量明显下降，表明添加的胶束不再解离，换句话说，CMC值已达到。在热图的最后部分，将更多浓缩的ACD-3胶束溶液添加到样品池时，出现由于胶束稀释引起的热效应，此时样品池中的ACD-3浓度远高于相应的CMC。为了获得相应的数值CMC值，ITC原始数据需进一步处理如下：（1）必须进行胶束稀释热量的减法；（2）必须对数据进行每摩尔ACD-3的标准化；（3）将所得的热量原始数据进行积分，以得到图6b中显示的热量Q与浓度C的曲线，最后，（4）CMC可以估算为此Q与C曲线的中点。然而，为了更精确地确定CMC值，Q与C数据可以拟合到合适的模型，从而轻松计算出相应的第一导数（见图6d）（这两个过程都可以通过简单的统计工具完成，例如GraphPad）。因此，CMC值对应于该导数曲线的最小值，如图6d中的箭头所示。根据ITC滴定曲线，胶束化焓（ΔH<sub>mic</sub>）可以通过滴定曲线的两个水平之间的焓差计算，如图6e所示。实验确定ΔH<sub>mic</sub>和CMC值后，可以计算其他热力学参数。胶束化自由能（ΔG<sub>mic</sub>）可以通过表达式ΔG<sub>mic</sub> = RT ln CMC′进行近似计算，其中R是气体常数（8.31e<sup>−3</sup> kJ/mol K），T是绝对温度，CMC′是以摩尔单位表示的临界胶束化浓度。与胶束化相关的熵变（TΔS<sub>mic</sub>）可以通过使用吉布斯-赫尔姆霍兹方程TΔS<sub>mic</sub> = ΔH<sub>mic</sub> − ΔG<sub>mic</sub>根据热力学第二定律计算。例如，图6f列出了为ACD-3 NV胶束化获得的所有热力学参数。如所见，熵的贡献主导了胶束化过程，焓起到了次要作用（|TΔS<sub>mic</sub>| ≫ |ΔH<sub>mic</sub>|），这与ACD-3单体周围水合作用壳中的水分子释放和随后的疏水力产生密切相关。</span>

## 3 siRNA/NV Complex Characterization siRNA/纳米载体复合物的表征

The ability of a nanocarrier to generate a stable complex with its nucleic acid cargo is a background postulate for its usefulness in gene delivery. A deep understanding about dimensions and morphology of the siRNA/NV complex is a key point for the experimental characterization. In line with what reported above, DLS-based quantities such as *R*H, *ζ*, and PDI coupled with TEM imaging can provide both qualitative and quantitative basic information also in the case of siRNA/NV complexes. Regarding the binding affinity between NV and siRNA, this property can be experimentally explored and quantified through the use of many different techniques, ranging from displacement assays (e.g., the standard Ethidium Bromide (EthBr) displacement fluorescence spectroscopy assay) to the more sophisticate and quantitative ITC. Also, the agarose gel retardation assay can provide further knowledge about a siRNA/NV complex formation and stability. It is worth to mention here that one of the most important physicochemical parameters for characterizing any given cationic siRNA/NV complex is the so-called ± ratio, that is the total number of positive charges on the cationic nanovector (+) divided by the total number of negative charges carried by the nucleic acid fragment (−). In the specific case of PAMAM-based cationic dendrimer, this ratio is defined as *N*/*P* (with *N* = number of dendrimer positively-charged nitrogen atoms and *P* = number of siRNA phosphate (P) groups), and it is used in place of the more standard concentration ratio in both in vitro and in vivo characterization and activity determination of these nanocarrier/siRNA systems.

<span style=color:blue>纳米载体与其核酸载荷能形成稳定复合物的能力，是其在基因递送中有效性的基本假设。深入了解siRNA/NV复合物的尺寸和形态，是实验表征的关键。正如前面所提到的，基于DLS的量化参数，如*R*H、*ζ*和PDI，结合TEM成像，能够为siRNA/NV复合物提供定性和定量的基本信息。关于NV和siRNA之间的结合亲和力，可以通过多种不同技术进行实验性研究和定量分析，从位移实验（例如标准的溴化乙啶（EthBr）位移荧光光谱法）到更为复杂和定量的ITC。此外，琼脂糖凝胶滞留实验也能进一步揭示siRNA/NV复合物的形成和稳定性。在此需要特别提到的是，用于表征任何阳离子siRNA/NV复合物的重要物理化学参数之一是±比率，即阳离子纳米载体上的正电荷总数（+）与核酸片段携带的负电荷总数（−）的比值。以PAMAM阳离子树状大分子为例，该比率定义为*N*/*P*（其中*N*表示树状大分子上正电荷氮原子的数量，*P*表示siRNA磷酸基团的数量），该比率被用来代替体外和体内表征及活性测定中更常见的浓度比。</span>

### 3.1 DLS and TEM

DLS (Subheading 2.1) and TEM (Subheading 2.2) are also widely employed for characterizing size and morphology of siRNA/NV complexes. As briefly discussed above, any ideal siRNA/NV complex should be characterized by dimension laying on the nanometric scale in order to display optimal cellular uptake and bioavailability. Concomitantly, the *ζ*-potential of these nanoassemblies should be high enough to ensure colloidal stability but also low enough to limit the related cytotoxic effects. Figure 7 shows the TEM and DLS results obtained for the nanocomplex formed between PAMAM-ACD-2 and siRNA as an example. These siRNA/NV nanoparticles are uniformly spherical in shape (Fig. 7a), with a diameter of ∼37 nm and characterized by a narrow PDI value of 0.20 (Fig. 7b). In addition, their *ζ* value is around +15 mV (Fig. 7c), implying stable colloidal property.

<span style=color:blue>DLS（小节2.1）和TEM（小节2.2）也常用于表征siRNA/NV复合物的尺寸和形态。如前所述，任何理想的siRNA/NV复合物应具有纳米尺度的尺寸，以便达到最佳的细胞摄取和生物利用度。同时，这些纳米组装体的*ζ*电位应足够高，以确保其胶体稳定性，但又不宜过高，以避免引发细胞毒性。图7展示了PAMAM-ACD-2与siRNA形成的纳米复合物的TEM和DLS结果作为示例。这些siRNA/NV纳米粒子呈均匀的球形（图7a），直径约为37纳米，并且PDI值较窄，为0.20（图7b）。此外，它们的*ζ*电位约为+15 mV（图7c），表明其具有稳定的胶体性质。</span>

### 3.2 ITC

The determination of the affinity of a given NV for a siRNA molecule is an exquisite example of ITC native function, i.e., measuring the heat change during a binding interaction between two molecular entities. Indeed, ITC is the only experimental technique that can directly capture the full binding thermodynamics of diverse biological interactions including protein-ligand binding, protein-protein binding, DNA-protein binding and, of course, nucleic acid-NV binding. ITC has the ability to precisely determine the change in Gibbs free energy (Δ*G*) and in its enthalpic (Δ*H*) and entropic (Δ*S*) components associated with binding. Figure 8 shows the raw calorimetric thermogram and the corresponding integrated values for an ITC experiment performed in order to determine the affinity of the PAMAM-ACD-2 NV for a siRNA. Basically, each injection of the siRNA solution into the sample cell containing a concentrated solution of the NV (*C* > CMC) triggers the relevant binding reaction, and the formation of the nanoassembly is accompanied by the release of heat (exothermic reaction). Hence, during the titration the detected signals are recorded as typical calorimetric peaks (Fig. 8a) which, upon integration, provide the amount of heat associated with each injection (Fig. 8b). As the NV micelles become saturated with siRNA fragments, the heat signal progressively diminishes until only the background heat, due to unspecific phenomena, is observed. With a procedure utterly similar to that discussed in Subheading 2.3, the complete set of the thermodynamic functions (Δ*G*, Δ*H*, and *T*Δ*S*) governing the binding interaction between the NV and the siRNA can be obtained from the data in Fig. 8b.

<span style=color:blue>给定NV与siRNA分子亲和力的测定是ITC本征功能的典型应用，即测量两种分子实体之间结合相互作用时的热量变化。实际上，ITC是唯一能够直接捕捉多种生物相互作用的完整热力学的实验技术，包括蛋白质-配体结合、蛋白质-蛋白质结合、DNA-蛋白质结合，当然也包括核酸-NV结合。ITC能够精确测定吉布斯自由能（Δ*G*）变化以及与结合相关的焓（Δ*H*）和熵（Δ*S*）成分。图8展示了为确定PAMAM-ACD-2 NV与siRNA亲和力所进行的ITC实验的原始热量热图和相应的积分数据。基本上，每次将siRNA溶液注入含有浓缩NV溶液的样品池中（*C* > CMC）都会引发相关的结合反应，纳米组装体的形成伴随着热量的释放（放热反应）。因此，在滴定过程中，检测到的信号记录为典型的热量峰值（图8a），通过积分可以得到与每次注射相关的热量值（图8b）。随着NV胶束逐渐饱和，热量信号逐步减弱，直到仅观察到由非特异性现象引起的背景热量。通过类似于小节2.3中描述的程序，可以从图8b的数据中获得描述NV与siRNA结合相互作用的完整热力学参数（Δ*G*、Δ*H*、和*T*Δ*S*）。</span>

**Fig. 8** Isothermal titration calorimetry raw (**a**) and integrated (**b**) data for titration of PAMAM-ACD-2 with siRNA in water (*T* = 25 °C). The dotted red line represents data fitting with a sigmoidal function. 

In the example illustrated in Fig. 8, the siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 complex exhibits a thermodynamically spontaneous supported by a largely negative (i.e., favorable) value of the corresponding binding free energy (Δ*G* = −9.78 kcal/mol). The driving force underlying the high NV affinity for its siRNA is prevalently enthalpic (Δ*H* = −6.53 kcal/mol), reflecting the essentially electrostatic nature of the siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 complex interaction (Fig.8). The related entropy variation is also favorable (i.e., positive, *T*Δ*S* = 3.25 kcal/mol), and can be ascribed to the release of water and counter ions from the siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 binding interface into bulk solvent.

### 3.3 Agarose Gel Retardation Analysis and RNAse A Assay 琼脂糖凝胶阻滞分析和 RNAse A 测定

Agarose gel electrophoresis is a useful technique to study the separation of nucleic acid fragments. It is also a simple, low cost, and rapid approach to monitor the complex formation between siRNA and NV and stability of siRNA/NV complexes in the presence of RNA-degrading enzymes such as RNases. The optimal composition for this analysis is a 1.2% of agarose in standard Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBE), and run time generally is about 15 min. The nucleic acid bands can be stained by EthBr or by the less toxic SYBR Green dye. In the case of CCD, for the agarose gel retardation analysis is important to remind that the complex formation depends on the dendrimer generation. Specifically, the positive end groups of a CCD can completely retard nucleic acid in the gels at high *N*/*P* ratios. In other words, higher CCD Gs are provided with the strongest interaction for nucleic acids, and hence the formed complex is more stable (Fig. 9).

<span style=color:blue>在图8中展示的示例中，siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2复合物表现出一个热力学上自发的过程，这主要得益于相应的结合自由能（Δ*G* = −9.78 kcal/mol）具有一个显著的负值（即，具有有利的自由能）。NV对其siRNA的高亲和性的主要驱动力是焓（Δ*H* = −6.53 kcal/mol），反映了siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2复合物相互作用的电静态本质（图8）。相关的熵变化也是有利的（即，正的，*T*Δ*S* = 3.25 kcal/mol），可以归因于从siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2结合界面向体积溶剂中释放水和反离子的现象。</span>

![485053_1_En_14_Fig9_HTML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zcgkiller/Pictures/main/Wechat/485053_1_En_14_Fig9_HTML.png)

**Fig. 9** Formation of siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 complexes revealed by agarose gel retardation analysis. This indicates that dendrimers of higher generations form more stable complexes, presumably due to their greater cooperativity between the -NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> end groups on the dendrimer and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> groups on the nucleic acid.

In addition, in order to study the stability of the siRNA/NV complexes a treatment with fixed concentration of RNase at incremental steps is commonly used (e.g., 0.25 μg/μL of RNase A for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 min at 37 °C). The RNase A enzyme in an endoribonuclease that specifically degrades single-stranded RNA at C and U residues. As reported in the Fig. 10, the degradation by RNase enzyme is prevented in the case of strong binding that occurs between siRNA molecules and their NVs. The final result indicates that PAMAM-CCD-G5 complexation effectively shields the siRNA fragments and protect them from degradation compared to naked siRNAs, for which the enzymatic digestion by the RNase is observed immediately (after 5 min). This implies that complexes are stable and are able to protect siRNA from degradation, independently of the nucleic acid length (25-mer or 27-mer, respectively).

<span style=color:blue>为了评估siRNA/NV复合物的稳定性，常通过逐步增加固定浓度RNase的处理时间来测试（例如，将0.25 μg/μL的RNase A在37°C下分别作用0、5、10、15、20、30、45、60、75、90和120分钟）。RNase A是一种特异性作用于单链RNA中C和U残基的内切核酸酶。从图10可以看出，当siRNA与其NV形成强结合时，可有效抵御RNase的降解。结果表明，PAMAM-CCD-G5复合物在屏蔽和保护siRNA免受酶降解方面效果显著，而裸露的siRNA几乎在处理后5分钟内就被完全降解。这说明这些复合物具有良好的稳定性，能够有效保护siRNA免受降解，无论其核酸链长为25-mer还是27-mer。</span>

**Fig. 10** The nanocomplex with PAMAM-CCD-G5 protects siRNA (**a**) 25-mer or (**b**) 27-mer from RNase degradation. Compared to the naked siRNA, the nucleic acid molecule complexed with PAMAM-CCD-G5 is resistant to RNase digestion and remains stable even after 120 min incubation. 

## 4 siRNA Cellular Uptake and Release siRNA 细胞摄取和释放

One of the crucial steps of the experimental characterization of NVs for siRNA delivery is verifying that the NV, once complexed with its cargo, is able to promote cellular uptake. Subsequently, the complex has to be able to perform endosomal escape into the cell cytoplasm, thereby releasing the siRNA and making it readily accessible to the cellular RNAi machinery for effective gene silencing. Along this complex pathway, the first important issues to check are whether the transported siRNA is able to specifically reach and if it can be internalized by the desired target cells. These requirements may be enabled using two strategies: passive and active targeting. The first approach relies on the (still controversial) intrinsic enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), according to which molecules with size in the nanometer range tend to accumulate in diseased tissues much more than they do in normal tissues. This is of particular relevance when exploiting RNAi in cancer treatment; here, the EPR effect refers to the preferential accumulation of nanoparticles within tumors owing to their leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage. On the other hand, active targeting employs functionalization or directed intermolecular interactions to confer higher specificity to a delivery system. Among others, the most exploited targeting groups for NV are peptides, folates, carbohydrates, and monoclonal antibodies. In this regard, it is essential to understand not only the effectiveness of recognition and uptake but also the precise underlying mechanism. Whether passive or active NV targeting strategies are employed, the verification of the uptake and the release of the siRNA/NV nanoassemblies into the cytoplasm must be carried out before any other evaluation of the silencing effectiveness.

<span style=color:blue>在siRNA递送纳米载体（NV）的实验研究中，验证复合物能否成功促进细胞摄取是至关重要的一步。此外，该复合物还需要具备进入细胞质内实现内体逃逸的能力，从而释放siRNA以被RNAi机制利用，从而实现有效的基因沉默。在这一复杂过程中，首要任务是确认递送的siRNA是否能够特异性到达目标细胞并被成功内化。为实现这些要求，通常采用被动靶向和主动靶向两种策略。**被动靶向**依赖于增强通透性和滞留效应（EPR效应）。这一机制（虽仍有争议）指出，纳米级分子更容易在病变组织中积累，特别是在癌症治疗中，EPR效应可导致纳米颗粒在肿瘤中的优先富集，这是因为肿瘤血管的渗漏性和淋巴系统的排出效率较低。**主动靶向**则通过分子功能化或特异性分子相互作用来增强递送系统的靶向性。常用的靶向分子包括肽类、叶酸、碳水化合物以及单克隆抗体。在这一过程中，研究不仅需要关注识别和摄取的效率，还需深入探讨其作用机制。无论选择被动靶向还是主动靶向策略，必须首先验证siRNA/NV复合物在目标细胞内的摄取与胞质内释放，这些是进一步评估基因沉默效果的基础。</span>

### 4.1 Flow Cytometry (FC) 流式细胞法

The current technological innovations in flow cytometry techniques actually permit their use in the study of cellular uptake of siRNA/NV complexes at the single cell level. FC is predominantly used to measure fluorescence intensity produced by siRNA/NV complexes tagged with fluorescent labels; however, appropriate cell models and target genes have to be used. In this context, we briefly discuss below our study on RNAi performed in human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) using a Cy5-labeled siRNA that targets the cancer cell survival gene *HSP27* (Heat Shock Protein gene 27). Specifically, our group reported that decoration of the siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 nanosystem with the targeting peptide E16G6RGDK results in its optimal cellular uptake in this cell line (Fig. 11a) . Moreover, the presence of this targeting peptide on the surface of the siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 assembly improves its delivery efficiency and specificity via a dual binding to ανβ3 integrin (overexpressed in tumor vasculature) and neuropilin-1 (a receptor present on tumor cells). Indeed, the internalization of the peptide-coated Cy5-siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK complexes in PC-3 cells is significantly higher (3×) than the corresponding noncoated Cy5-siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 complexes (Fig. 11b). In addition, the uptake of the Cy5-siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK complexes is considerably reduced in the presence of a specific ανβ3 integrin binder such as the cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptide (Fig. 11b,c). This clearly demonstrates that cRGD competes with the E16G6RGDK-coated siRNA/NV complexes for integrin binding via specific interaction with the integrin-binding RGD motif.

<span  style=color:blue>流式细胞术（FC）近年来的技术进步，使其能够在单细胞水平研究siRNA/NV复合物的摄取情况。通过荧光标记的siRNA/NV复合物产生的荧光信号，可通过FC进行定量分析，但前提是选用适当的细胞模型和靶基因。在这里，我们简要介绍了一项在前列腺癌细胞系PC-3中进行的RNAi实验，使用Cy5标记的siRNA针对癌细胞存活基因*HSP27*（热休克蛋白基因27）的表达。我们的研究表明，靶向肽E16G6RGDK修饰后的siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2纳米系统，在PC-3细胞中表现出最佳的摄取效率（图11a）。这种靶向肽通过结合αvβ3整合素（肿瘤血管中过表达）和神经纤毛蛋白-1（肿瘤细胞上的受体），显著提高了纳米系统的递送效率和靶向特异性。与未修饰的Cy5-siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2复合物相比，包被E16G6RGDK肽的复合物在PC-3细胞中的内化水平提高了约3倍（图11b）。此外，当加入特异性αvβ3整合素配体（如环状RGD肽，cRGD）时，Cy5-siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK复合物的摄取量显著降低（图11b, 11c）。这清楚地证明，cRGD通过特异性与整合素结合的RGD基序竞争性阻止了E16G6RGDK肽修饰复合物的整合素结合。</span>

(**c**) FC analysis of the cellular uptake of siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK complexes in the absence and presence of cyclic RGD (cRGD). 

### 4.2 Confocal Microscopy 共聚焦显微镜法

The characterization of siRNA uptake and release can be further validated and/or expanded by combining FC-based analyses with an integrative approach such as confocal microscopy (CM) . Indeed, CM permits the visual localization of the same fluorescently labeled complexes used in FC experiments. Additionally, CM co-localization analysis allows to determine whether two or more different molecules locate in the same cellular compartment. Figure 12 reports an example of the CM analysis for the cellular uptake of the siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK complex discussed above. As it can be observed in Fig. 12, pretreating PC-3 cells with an anti neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) receptor antibody dramatically reduces the internalization of the Cy5-siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK complex compared to antibody-untreated cells, thereby confirming that the postulated second mechanism of cellular uptake—i.e., via Nrp-1 receptor interaction—is also effectively in place for this targeted nanoassembly.

<span style=color:blue>为了更全面地表征siRNA的摄取和释放过程，可以将流式细胞术（FC）与共聚焦显微镜（CM）等方法结合使用。共聚焦显微镜可以直接观察到在流式实验中使用的荧光标记复合物的定位情况。此外，CM的共定位分析能够判断两种或多种分子是否位于相同的细胞区室中。图12展示了上述siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK复合物在细胞摄取中的共聚焦显微分析结果。可以看出，与未处理的细胞相比，用抗神经纤毛蛋白-1（Nrp-1）受体抗体预处理PC-3细胞后，Cy5-siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK复合物的内化显著减少。这表明该靶向纳米载体确实通过Nrp-1受体的相互作用实现了细胞摄取的另一种机制。</span>

**Fig. 12** CM imaging of the cellular uptake of siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 complexes with the targeting peptide E16G6RGDK in the absence and presence of a Nrp-1-receptor antibody. 

CM can also be used to investigate different cellular process dynamics in living cells. A representative example in the NV-mediated siRNA delivery field is reported in the study discussed below, in which we used far-red fluorescent dye Alexa647-labeled siRNAs to transfect PC-3 cells in presence or absence of PAMAM-CCD-G5 NVs. The results shown in Fig. 13a indicate that PAMAM-CCD-G5 is indeed quite effective in mediating siRNA cellular uptake.

<span style=color:blue>共聚焦显微镜还可用于观察活细胞中分子动态过程。例如，在一项NV介导的siRNA递送研究中，我们使用远红荧光染料Alexa647标记的siRNA，并在有无PAMAM-CCD-G5 NV的条件下对PC-3细胞进行转染。图13a的结果清晰地表明，PAMAM-CCD-G5在介导siRNA细胞摄取方面表现出高效性。</span>

**Fig. 13** Uptake of Alexa647-labeled siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 complexes on PC-3 cells analyzed by live-cell confocal microscopy (**a**), using specific inhibitors (**b**) and fluorescent endocytic biomarkers (**c**) of different uptake pathways and phalloidin probe for actin rearrangement (**d**). (**a**) Blue channel image of the nuclei of PC-3 cells stained by Hoechst 34580 (left), red channel image of the Alexa647-labeled siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 nanoparticles (red), and merged image of both (right). (**b**) Effect of cytochalasin D (to inhibit macropinocytosis), genistein (to inhibit caveolae-mediated endocytosis), and chlorpromazine (to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis) on the cell uptake of the Alexa647-labeled siRNA/G5 complexes. (**c**) Colocalization of Alexa647-labeled siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 complexes with different endocytic markers: dextran (marker of macropinocytosis), cholera toxin B (marker of caveolae-mediated endocytosis), and transferrin (marker of clathrin-mediated endocytosis), green channel image of the Alexa488-labeled different endocytic biomarkers. (**d**) Fluorescent labeling of actin fibers using Alexa647-labeled phalloidin reveals actin depolymerization, a hallmark of macropinocytosis.

The different mechanisms governing the cellular uptake of siRNA/NV nano-ensembles (e.g., macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and caveolae-mediated endocytosis) can also be identified by CM. For instance, each endocytosis pathway can be individually and selectively investigated by using specific inhibitors and/or specific endocytic markers. As a proof-of-concept, to determine the mechanism underlying the cell internalization of the siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 complexes in Fig. 13 we employed cytochalasin D as a macropinocytosis inhibitor, genistein to inhibit caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and chlorpromazine to block chlatrin-mediated uptake (Fig. 13b). In the same context, we also used CM to eventually co-localize the internalized siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 nanoparticles with dextran, cholera toxin B, and transferrin as markers of the three main endocytosis pathways, respectively (Fig. 13c). Concerning the use of endocytosis inhibitors, from Fig. 13b it is clearly seen that a significant reduction in the cellular uptake of the siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 complexes is observed only when the cells are treated with cytochalasin D, leading to the conclusion that macropinocytosis is the prevailing internalization mechanism for these supermolecular nanoassemblies (Fig. 13b). In line, the Alexa647 labeled siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 complexes are mainly found to co-localize with the macropinocytosis marker dextran, whereas only a minor colocalization is detected with the markers of the two alternative uptake pathways (Fig. 13c). As a final observation, significant actin depolymerization—an additional hallmark of macropinocytosis—is also observed after siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 complex internalization (Fig. 13d).

<span style=color:blue>通过共聚焦显微镜（CM），可以研究siRNA/NV纳米载体的多种细胞摄取机制，例如大吞饮作用、网格蛋白介导的内吞和小窝介导的内吞等。这些内化途径可以通过使用特定的抑制剂或内吞标记物分别加以验证。例如，为了研究图13中siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5复合物的内化机制，实验中采用环孢菌素D抑制大吞饮作用，染料木黄酮抑制小窝介导内吞，以及氯丙嗪阻断网格蛋白介导的摄取（图13b）。同时，我们还通过CM观察到内化的siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5复合物与三种主要内吞途径的标记物——葡聚糖（大吞饮）、霍乱毒素B（小窝介导内吞）以及转铁蛋白（网格蛋白介导内吞）的共定位情况（图13c）。从图13b可以明显看出，只有在用环孢菌素D处理细胞时，siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5复合物的摄取量显著降低。这表明大吞饮作用是这些纳米超分子组装的主要内化机制。此外，Alexa647标记的siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5复合物主要与大吞饮标记物葡聚糖共定位，而与其他两种途径标记物的共定位则较少（图13c）。更进一步，实验还观察到在siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5复合物内化后，肌动蛋白发生显著去聚合，这也是大吞饮作用的典型特征（图13d）。</span>

Once siRNA/NV complexes are internalized into target cells, their endosome entrapment and the subsequent successful escape into the cytoplasm are two fundamental stages in the complex RNAi process, which can still be investigated via CM using, e.g., LysoTracker, which fluorescently labels acidic compartments. The siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK nanosystem presented above (Figs. 11 and 12) offers a good example in this respect. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 14 these Cy5-labeled nucleic acid/NV targeted nanoparticles completely co-localize with the LysoTracker marker already 30 min post PC-3 cell incubation (p.c.i.), indicating their complete endosome entrapment. Importantly, however, after another 30′ (1-h total) this colocalization is less evident, suggesting that some of the nanocomplexes have effectively escaped from the endosomes into the cytoplasm. The almost quantitative endosomal escape is further confirmed by CM imaging performed 2 h p.c.i., in which the fluorescent signals from the siRNA-containing nanoassemblies are mainly diffused through the cell cytoplasm.

<span style=color:blue>当siRNA/NV复合物内化进入靶细胞后，其在内体中的捕获和随后成功逃逸至细胞质是RNAi机制中的两个重要步骤。使用共聚焦显微镜（CM）可以研究这些过程，例如借助LysoTracker对细胞内的酸性区室进行荧光标记。以siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK纳米系统为例（图11和12），该系统展示了内体捕获和逃逸的典型特性。正如图14所示，在与PC-3细胞孵育30分钟后，这些Cy5标记的核酸/NV靶向纳米颗粒与LysoTracker完全共定位，表明复合物被内体完全捕获。然而，在孵育1小时时，这种共定位现象明显减少，暗示部分复合物已成功逃逸至细胞质。进一步的CM成像结果显示，孵育2小时后，含siRNA的纳米颗粒荧光信号主要分布于细胞质中，验证了几乎完全的内体逃逸。</span>

## 5 In Vitro Silencing Activity 体外沉默活性

As it is well known, NVs are used in order to quantitatively transport and delivery siRNAs that, by silencing specific disease-related genes, ultimately suppress the corresponding mRNA expression and, hence, the synthesis of the related encoded protein(s). As our own experience in the field mainly refers to NV-assisted RNAi in cancer, and prostate cancer (PC) in particular, this specific application will be used as a proof-of-concept in this section. PC is one of the most common cancers in industrialized countries, and anticancer treatments based on molecular targeting of survival genes using RNAi can constitute a novel and promising approach for this pathology. As mentioned in Subheading 4.1, the *HSP27* gene and its encoded Hsp27 protein (an ATP-independent molecular chaperone upregulated by hormonal ablation and chemotherapy) is now recognized as an important therapeutic target in prostate cancer for which a specific targeted siRNA has been recently developed. Accordingly, we investigated the ability of the different cationic NVs characterized in the previous sections to elicit RNAi in PC both in vitro and in vivo. The techniques employed in these investigations constitute the topic of the last part of this chapter.

<span style=color:blue>众所周知，纳米载体（NVs）可以高效运输和递送siRNA，通过靶向沉默与疾病相关的特定基因，从而抑制mRNA的表达并阻断相关蛋白的合成。鉴于我们在NV辅助RNAi领域的研究重点主要聚焦于癌症治疗，特别是前列腺癌（PC），本节将以该具体应用为实例进行说明。前列腺癌是工业化国家中最常见的癌症之一，而基于RNAi技术靶向关键存活基因的治疗方法为该疾病提供了新的可能。如4.1节所述，*HSP27*基因及其编码的Hsp27蛋白已被公认为前列腺癌治疗中的重要靶点。Hsp27是一种ATP非依赖性分子伴侣，其在激素剥夺和化疗后显著上调，针对它的特异性siRNA已被开发。基于此，我们系统评估了前述章节中描述的不同阳离子NV在体内和体外触发RNAi的能力。本章最后部分将探讨这些研究所采用的技术。</span>

### 5.1 Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) 定量实时聚合酶链反应

(qRT)-PCR is the standard technique that quantifies nucleic acids. Accordingly, it is routinely used to determine the levels of residual mRNA expression after the corresponding specific gene silencing via RNAi. In brief, this quantification methodology measures the changes in gene expression in a sample of interest relative to a reference sample. The protocol usually involves three main steps, that is (1) a reverse transcription step in which the RNA is converted into a complementary DNA copy (cDNA), (2) several rounds of cDNA amplification, and finally (3) the detection and quantification of the amplified products in real time. Figure 15a reports an example of qRT-PCR results showing how a *HSP27*-targeted siRNA delivered by the PAMAM-CCD-G5 NV results in effective and specific gene silencing and anticancer activity in a prostate cancer PC-3 cell model. As it can be seen, the levels of the *HSP27* mRNA expression are reduced by approximately 75% when the *HSP27* targeting siRNA is delivered by the cationic dendrimer NV with respect to untreated cells. Further, this potent gene silencing effect is specific, since cell transfection with a scramble siRNA delivered by the same NV (i.e., a siRNA with a random sequence) or the NV alone do not produce any noticeable effect. Panel b in Fig. 15 shows another aspect of RNAi obtained with the same *HSP27* siRNA yet delivered to PC-3 cells via the PAMAM-ACD-2 NV, both in the presence and in the absence of the E16G6RGDK targeting peptide (*see* Subheadings 4.1 and 4.2). Indeed, from this figure it can be observed how the presence of the targeting moieties on the surface of the ACD-2 NVs results in a significant increase of *HSP27* silencing at the corresponding mRNA level compared to the non-coated siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 complexes (Fig. 15b).

<span style=color:blue>定量实时聚合酶链反应（qRT-PCR）是核酸检测的核心技术，经常被用于评估RNAi靶向基因沉默后的残余mRNA水平。这一技术通过比较目标样本与参考样本的基因表达差异，实现对基因表达变化的定量分析。qRT-PCR的流程通常包括三个步骤：(1) 反转录步骤，将RNA逆转录为cDNA；(2) 对cDNA进行多轮扩增；(3) 实时监测并定量扩增产物的浓度。图15a显示了一项qRT-PCR实验结果，通过PAMAM-CCD-G5纳米载体递送的*HSP27*特异性siRNA在前列腺癌PC-3细胞中有效抑制了*HSP27*基因表达，展现出优异的抗癌活性。实验结果表明，与未处理的细胞相比，*HSP27* mRNA的表达水平降低了约75%。此外，这一基因沉默效应具有高度特异性；随机序列siRNA（scramble siRNA）或未加载siRNA的载体并未对基因表达产生显著影响。图15b则进一步揭示了靶向修饰对RNAi效率的影响。通过PAMAM-ACD-2载体递送靶向*HSP27*的siRNA，在加载E16G6RGDK靶向肽后，*HSP27* mRNA的沉默效果显著优于未修饰载体，表明靶向基团的加入显著提升了基因沉默的效率（图15b）。</span>

**Fig. 15** Targeted gene silencing effect determined using qRT-PCR show effective and specific gene silencing and anticancer activity in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. (**a**) *HSP27* siRNA/PAMAM-CCD-G5 complex mediated downregulation of *HSP27* mRNA expression. (**b**) *HSP27* silencing at mRNA level with siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK shows how the complex system is much more effective than the un-coated siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 system for *HSP27* silencing and antiproliferation in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. 

### 5.2 Western Blotting (WB)

WB is a prototypical molecular biology technique used to detect and identify specific proteins of interest in a sample of tissue homogenate or extract. Typically, WB first require protein separation by gel electrophoresis—a method for the separation and analysis of macromolecules including DNA, RNA , and proteins and their fragments, based on their size and charge. The gel (usually Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE)) is then placed next to a nitrocellulose or PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane, and the application of an electric field causes the proteins to migrate from the gel to the membrane. Finally, the membrane is probed by antibodies targeting the proteins under investigation, and visualized using secondary antibodies and detection reagents. As such, WB is normally used in tandem with (qRT)-PCR to evaluate RNAi efficiency at the protein level. For the purpose, a housekeeping protein that is constitutively expressed at high levels in most cells and tissues is used as positive loading control and for the relative quantification of the protein(s) under study (via the ratio of the intensity of each protein WB band relative to that of the control). In addition, non-transfected cells and/or cells transfected with another non-targeting siRNA complex are also analyzed as negative controls. Finally, Fig. 16 shows the WB results for the *HSP27* targeting siRNA delivered by the same NV systems discussed above, i.e., PAMAM-CCD-G and PAMAM-ACD-2. As shown in this figure panels, the gene silencing results determined at the mRNA by (qRT)-PCR (Fig. 15) are confirmed by the corresponding WB evidences at the protein level, as a significant suppression of the Hsp27 protein expression is achieved via siRNA delivery promoted both by the covalent PAMAM-CCD-G5 NV (Fig. 16a) and by the peptide-coated PAMAM-ACD-2 nanocarrier (Fig. 16b).

<span style=color:blue>Western Blotting（WB）是分子生物学中常用的一种技术，用于检测和鉴定组织样品中的特定蛋白质。该方法的基本流程包括三个步骤：首先，通过凝胶电泳（如SDS-PAGE）将蛋白质按照分子大小和电荷进行分离；其次，将分离后的蛋白质从凝胶转移到硝酸纤维素或PVDF膜上；最后，利用特异性抗体进行蛋白质探测，并通过二抗及相关试剂进行信号可视化。WB通常与qRT-PCR联合使用，以从蛋白质水平验证RNAi的基因沉默效率。实验中通常使用管家蛋白作为正对照，以校正目标蛋白的相对表达量，同时分析未转染和随机siRNA转染的细胞作为阴性对照。图16展示了*HSP27*靶向siRNA通过PAMAM-CCD-G5和PAMAM-ACD-2纳米载体递送后的WB结果，证实了之前qRT-PCR在mRNA水平上所显示的基因沉默效应。无论是PAMAM-CCD-G5（图16a）还是PAMAM-ACD-2（图16b）递送的siRNA，都能显著抑制Hsp27蛋白的表达。</span>

### 5.3 MTT Assay

With specific reference to RNAi in cancer therapeutics, quite often the genes targeted for silencing play a major role in the regulation of cellular apoptosis, i.e., a form of programmed cell death. As mentioned above, *HSP27* is one of such genes, as it is upregulated in cancer cells and plays a significant role in apoptosis inhibition. Accordingly, once its siRNA/NV-mediated silencing has been verified, the evaluation of the related effect on cancer cell growth constitutes another fundamental step. The 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay is currently the most commonly used method to test cytotoxicity effects on cellular viability. This is an assay that measures the color change from the yellow MTT to the dark purple insoluble formazan upon reduction by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. This process occurs only in metabolically active cells; thus, the level of mitochondrial activity is a convenient marker of proliferation of viable cells. Figure 17 reports the results of MTT assays performed on PC-3 cells after treatment with *HSP27*-directed siRNA in complex with the PAMAM-CCD-G5 (Fig. 17a) or with PAMAM-ACD-2 (Fig. 17b) NVs, respectively, from which the relevant significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation upon RNAi can be readily observed. Also, the specificity of the cytotoxic effect can be readily appreciated, as cell transfection with a scrambled siRNA or with the NVs alone indeed results in cell viability comparable to that of the control (untreated cells).

<span style=color:blue>在癌症治疗中，RNAi技术通常靶向与细胞凋亡密切相关的基因。例如，*HSP27*基因在癌细胞中上调并抑制凋亡，是一个典型的靶点。在验证其通过siRNA和纳米载体介导的沉默效果后，进一步评估这种基因沉默对癌细胞增殖的抑制作用至关重要。MTT实验是检测细胞毒性和活力的经典方法，它利用线粒体琥珀酸脱氢酶将黄色的MTT染料还原为紫色的甲臜，从而反映细胞的代谢活性。该方法特别适用于研究RNAi对细胞增殖的影响。图17展示了PC-3细胞分别使用PAMAM-CCD-G5（图17a）和PAMAM-ACD-2（图17b）递送的*HSP27*靶向siRNA后的MTT结果，结果显示，RNAi显著抑制了癌细胞增殖。此外，与随机序列siRNA或仅使用纳米载体处理的细胞相比，靶向处理的特异性毒性效果也得到了验证，对照组细胞活力几乎未受影响。</span>

## 6 In Vivo Gene Silencing Activity 体内基因沉默活性

The in vivo efficacy of any siRNA/NV system is likely the phase of the entire NV-assisted RNAi process for which the development of standardized protocols is the most complex. Given the wide heterogenicity of genetic disorders, it is almost impossible to define a common roadmap for determining the actual efficacy of NV-mediated siRNA delivery and the corresponding gene silencing effect. Focusing on cancer , and even within a specific tumor, the number of variables to consider during any in vivo experimental campaign aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a therapeutic agent remains very large. Among these variables, however, reasonably the most important ones are represented by the tumor type, its location, the specific etiological agent from which cancer is initiated, and the corresponding diagnostic targets. Given such a broadness of subject, in this chapter final section we will still refer to our own experience and describe some of the main techniques and procedures adopted to verify the in vivo efficacy of siRNA/NV complexes in cancer—and in PC in particular. Yet, as it is the case of the methodologies discussed in the preceding sections, these techniques can easily be adopted and/or adapted for the in vivo characterization of NV-promoted RNAi aimed at treating different cancers/diseases. In our studies, PC-3 xenografted nude mouse models are generated to evaluate the in vivo NV-mediated silencing of *HSP27* as targeted by the corresponding siRNA. According to protocol, mice are sacrificed 1 week after siRNA/NV complex delivery via intratumoral injection, and the corresponding expression of Hsp27 mRNA and protein in the tumors is assessed by qRT-PCR and WB, respectively. It is important to remark here that the animal health must be constantly monitored, and that the institutional guidelines for the proper and ethical research animal use and sacrifice must be strictly followed in all in vivo experiment.

<span style=color:blue>验证siRNA/NV系统的体内疗效是NV辅助RNAi研究中最复杂的环节之一，由于遗传性疾病的多样性，很难制定统一的标准化方案来评估其基因沉默效果。以癌症为例，即使针对特定肿瘤类型，评估治疗剂效果时仍需考虑多种变量，包括肿瘤的类型、位置、病因及相关诊断靶点。在本章的最后，我们结合实际经验，介绍了验证siRNA/NV复合物在癌症（尤其是前列腺癌）体内疗效的主要技术方法。这些方法同样适用于其他癌症或疾病的RNAi研究。在我们的研究中，我们使用PC-3细胞构建了移植瘤裸鼠模型，用以评估NV介导的*HSP27*靶向siRNA在体内的基因沉默效果。根据实验流程，siRNA/NV复合物通过瘤内注射递送后1周，对小鼠进行处置，并利用qRT-PCR和WB分别检测肿瘤组织中Hsp27的mRNA和蛋白表达水平。同时需注意，所有体内实验必须遵循伦理准则，确保动物健康得到严格监控，并按照规定对实验动物进行人道处置。</span>

### 6.1 In Vivo Delivery and Gene Silencing 体内递送与基因沉默

Our procedure implies measuring and recording mice tumor size and weight regularly during the entire siRNA treatment. After mice euthanasia, tumors are excised and readily subjected to gene silencing analysis. In order to be able to assess tumor targeting capability by ex vivo imaging, a fluorescently labeled siRNA must have been delivered. As a first example of the relevant results, Fig. 18 shows the ex-vivo imaging (Fig. 18a) and the relevant quantification (Fig.  18b) of the in vivo efficacy of *HSP27* gene silencing achieved upon delivery of the specific siRNA via the PAMAM-ACD-2 NV. Also, from the same figure the enhanced RNAi effect achieved upon NV decoration with the E16G6RGDK can be readily appreciated.

<span style=color:blue>实验中，我们定期监测和记录小鼠肿瘤的大小和重量，以评估siRNA治疗效果。在小鼠处置后，立即切取肿瘤组织进行基因沉默分析。为了利用离体成像技术评估肿瘤的靶向递送能力，需在实验前递送荧光标记的siRNA。图18展示了PAMAM-ACD-2纳米载体递送特异性siRNA后*HSP27*基因沉默的离体成像结果（图18a）及其定量分析（图18b）。从结果中可以明显看到，载体修饰E16G6RGDK肽后，RNAi效果得到了显著增强。</span>

Furthermore, Fig. 19 reveals the results from qRT-PCR (Subheading 5.1) and WB (Subheading 5.2) analysis performed on the total Hsp27 mRNA and protein as extracted from the xenografted mice excised tumors. In agreement with the relevant in vitro data (Figs. 15 and 16), these evidences confirm that a successful and potent *HSP27* silencing effect can be achieved in vivo upon specific siRNA delivery promoted by the PAMAM-CCD-G5 at mRNA (Fig. 19a) and protein level (Fig. 19b).

<span style=color:blue>此外，图19显示了从移植瘤小鼠肿瘤组织中提取的Hsp27 mRNA和蛋白质的qRT-PCR（参见5.1节）和WB（参见5.2节）分析结果。与体外实验数据（图15和图16）一致，这些结果进一步证实，通过PAMAM-CCD-G5载体递送的特异性siRNA可以有效沉默*HSP27*，并在mRNA（图19a）和蛋白水平（图19b）上表现出强大的体内基因抑制效果。</span>

### 6.2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 免疫组化

IHC is another microscopy-based technique that can be employed to visualize cellular proteins or other macromolecules in tissue samples upon staining with specific antibodies. One of the IHC strong points is its intuitive output, which visually unveils the existence and localization of, e.g., a specific protein in the context of different cell types, biological states, and/or subcellular localization within complex tissues. For instance, in cancer therapeutics, high expression levels of the antigen Ki-67—a nuclear protein required for cellular proliferation—are associated with tumor aggression, vascular invasion, tumor metastasis, and poor response to chemotherapy. As such, it is often used as a marker for the progression of cancer cells in tumor tissues. An example of IHC images showing a strong inhibition of cancer cell proliferation after in vivo administration of siRNA in complexes with the PAMAM-CCD-G5 or the PAMAM-ACD-2 NVs is given in Fig. 20. As seen from the images, IHC of Ki-67 in tumors treated with the Hsp27 specific siRNA delivered by either of the two cationic NVs immediately reveals a substantially lower number of proliferative cells in the PC tissues with respect to the corresponding untreated controls.

<span style=color:blue>免疫组化（IHC）是一种显微镜技术，通过使用特异性抗体染色，可以在组织样本中定位和检测特定蛋白或其他大分子。其优势在于结果的直观性，使研究者能直接观察目标蛋白在不同细胞类型、生物状态或复杂组织亚细胞中的分布。在癌症研究中，Ki-67（细胞增殖所需的核蛋白）被广泛应用作为肿瘤进展的标志物，因为其高表达通常与肿瘤侵袭性、转移性以及化疗效果不佳相关。图20提供了一个IHC图像的示例，展示了通过PAMAM-CCD-G5或PAMAM-ACD-2纳米载体递送siRNA后癌细胞增殖受到明显抑制的情况。从结果来看，与对照组相比，递送Hsp27特异性siRNA的处理组中，PC肿瘤组织中的增殖细胞数量明显减少。</span>

## 7 Toxicity 毒性

In spite of the wide applications of cationic dendrimers in drug delivery, their use in biomedical applications is still limited mainly because of their intrinsic toxicity. Indeed, the presence of a highly positively surface charge density on these NVs may result in cellular membrane disruption via nanohole formation, membrane thinning, and erosion. Therefore, in the development of any alternative, new cationic dendrimer-based NV , the determination of the relevant toxicity profile remains a mandatory step required for an eventual translational phase. In this respect, a comparison with the results obtained from a scrambled (aka non-silencing) siRNA, and the selection of cell lines not correlated with the studied pathology are also obligatory conditions.

<span style=color:blue>尽管阳离子树枝状分子因其在药物递送领域的广泛应用而备受关注，但由于其固有的毒性，其在生物医学中的实际应用仍受到限制。这主要归因于其表面高密度正电荷可能导致的细胞膜损伤，包括纳米孔形成、膜变薄及侵蚀效应。因此，开发新的阳离子树枝状分子基纳米载体时，评估其毒性特征是临床转化的关键环节。同时，实验设计需包括与非特异性siRNA的比较及与目标病理无关的细胞系的测试，以确保结果的可靠性。</span>

### 7.1 MTT and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay MTT和乳酸脱氢酶实验

To investigate nonspecific toxicity, both the MMT assay (*see* Subheading 5.3) and the LDH assay—which determines the membrane integrity by quantifying the lactate dehydrogenase released from cells into the extracellular medium —can be routinely adopted. As illustrated in Fig. 21 for the delivery of *HSP27*-directed siRNA assisted by the siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 or the siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK NVs, the results from both MTT and LDH assays reveal that no metabolic toxicity or membrane damage is induced either in PC-3 cells (Fig. 21a,b) or in the disease-unrelated HEK293 control cells (Fig. 21c,d).

<span style=color:blue>评估非特异性毒性时，常用MTT实验（*参见*5.3小节）和LDH实验。LDH实验通过检测释放至细胞外的乳酸脱氢酶水平来反映细胞膜完整性。如图21所示，针对*HSP27*的siRNA在PAMAM-ACD-2或PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK纳米载体的辅助下进行递送时，MTT和LDH实验均表明，无论在PC-3细胞（图21a,b）还是疾病无关的HEK293对照细胞（图21c,d）中，均未引发显著的代谢毒性或细胞膜损伤。</span>

### 7.2 Hemolysis Experiment 溶血实验

A potential toxic effect of nanoassemblies on red blood cells (RBCs), namely hemolysis, can be extremely dangerous during in vivo administration. Indeed, RBCs are among the first cells that come into contact with external materials in the blood system. Therefore, any eventual hemolytic toxicity—as marked by the release of hemoglobin from erythrocytes—must be carefully determined for every NV per se and in complex with its nucleic acid cargo. Briefly, washed RBCs suspensions must be incubated with different concentrations of the investigated nanoassembly; in parallel, positive and negative control experiments must be carried out. Specifically, a 1.0% solution of the surfactant TritonX-100 used as positive control causes a complete hemolysis of the sample, while pure phosphate buffered saline (PBS) is normally chosen as the negative control. All samples are then centrifuged and the UV absorbance of the supernatant is measured at 540 nm to detect the release of hemoglobin from the eventually damaged cells. An example of the results from the hemolysis assay is given in Fig. 22, from which the enhancement in the protective effect against hemolysis achieved by, e.g., decorating the surface of the siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 complex with the E16G6RGDK targeting peptide with respect to the uncoated complex or to ACD nanovector alone is well evident. This result can be ascribed to a decrease in the overall positive surface charge characterizing the decorated nanoassembly.

<span style=color:blue>纳米组装体对红细胞（RBCs）的潜在毒性——溶血效应——在体内给药时可能带来极大危险。红细胞是血液系统中最早与外来物质接触的细胞之一。因此，任何可能的溶血性毒性（通过红细胞释放血红蛋白来识别）都必须对每种纳米载体及其与核酸负载的复合物进行严格评估。简而言之，将洗净的红细胞悬液与不同浓度的纳米组装体孵育；同时，还要进行阳性对照和阴性对照实验。具体而言，1.0%的表面活性剂TritonX-100溶液作为阳性对照，会引发红细胞的完全溶血，而纯磷酸盐缓冲盐水（PBS）则作为阴性对照。所有样品随后经过离心，测定上清液在540 nm波长下的紫外吸光度，以检测血红蛋白的释放。图22展示了溶血实验的一个示例，结果表明，当将E16G6RGDK靶向肽修饰到siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2复合物的表面时，相比于未修饰的复合物或单独的ACD纳米载体，溶血保护效果显著增强。此结果归因于修饰纳米组装体表面正电荷的整体减少。</span>

(**b**) Quantitative analysis of hemolysis determined by UV absorption at 540 nm. 

### 7.3 In Vivo Toxicity Evaluation 体内毒性评估

Finally, general in vivo toxicity assessments have to be performed to conclude the whole basic set of cationic NV characterization experiments. Generally, these include the administration of the siRNA/NV complex under development in healthy mice and the subsequent evaluation of any signs of discomfort, unusual behavior, or body weight change in comparison with a mice cohort treated with the PBS as a negative control. A reasonably complete in vivo toxicity profile of a NV/siRNA nanosystem can be obtained through the Luminex-detection technology-assisted quantification of different induced inflammation and inflammatory factors—such as Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interferon-γ (INF-γ), Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) , Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), Keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), and Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) —and several major serum biochemistry parameters, including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) , total bilirubin (TBIL), urea , total protein (TP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), triacylglycerol (TG), and total cholesterol (TCHO) . A typical output from this analysis is reported in Fig. 23a,b. In this example, healthy mice treated with either the E16G6RGDK targeted or the nontargeted siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 systems show no evidence of induced inflammation, whereas mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as positive control exhibit significantly elevated levels of the abovementioned inflammatory factors (Fig. 23a). Moreover, the major serum biochemistry parameters remain at normal levels at 24 h post-administration, indicating that the function of the main organs is not affected by the treatment with these siRNA/NV formulations (Fig. 23b).

<span style=color:blue>最后，为了完成整个阳离子纳米载体（NV）的基础表征实验，需要进行一般的体内毒性评估。通常，这包括将待开发的siRNA/NV复合物注入健康小鼠，并观察与PBS处理的小鼠对照组相比，是否出现不适症状、异常行为或体重变化。通过Luminex检测技术定量诱导的炎症因子（如白介素6、干扰素-γ、肿瘤坏死因子-α、粒细胞-巨噬细胞集落刺激因子、单核细胞趋化蛋白-1等）和血清生化参数（如丙氨酸转氨酶、天冬氨酸转氨酶、总胆红素、尿素、总蛋白、碱性磷酸酶、甘油三酯和总胆固醇），可以获得较为全面的体内毒性信息。图23a,b展示了该分析的典型结果。在该示例中，接受E16G6RGDK靶向或非靶向siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2治疗的健康小鼠未出现炎症反应，而接受脂多糖（LPS）作为阳性对照的组则出现了炎症因子显著升高（图23a）。此外，主要血清生化参数在给药24小时后仍保持在正常范围，表明这些siRNA/NV配方未对主要器官功能造成影响（图23b）。</span>

(**a**) Cytokine response in mice determined by quantifying the serum levels of inflammation and inflammatory factors at 3 h post-injection. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as the positive control. (**b**) Major serum biochemistry parameters measured in mouse serum collected at 24 h post-injection. (**c**) Histopathological analysis of major organs from mice treated with siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 and siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK. Tissue samples were collected at 24 h post-administration.

The corresponding histological analysis of the main organs collected at 24 h posttreatment (Fig. 23c) reveals that both siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2 and siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK are devoid of acute toxicity since no significant pathological change can be observed in any of the tissue sections (Fig. 23c).

<span style=color:blue>治疗后24小时收集的主要器官的组织学分析（图23c）表明，siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2和siRNA/PAMAM-ACD-2/E16G6RGDK未表现出急性毒性，因为在所有组织切片中均未见显著的病理变化（图23c）。</span>

## 8 Conclusion 讨论

In the last 10 years, the number of studies involving NVs as safe, efficient, and effective nanocarriers for siRNA delivery has increased exponentially. In particular, CCDs and ACDs PAMAM-based NVs bearing primary and positively charged amine groups are the optimal candidates for effectively forming nanoscale siRNA delivery systems. In this respect, our research group made significant progress in designing, synthesizing, characterizing, and testing both covalent and self-assembled nanovectors for siRNA delivery. We developed a hierarchical approach to control each phase of the experimental characterization on these NVs and the relevant complex with their nucleic cargos. From our approach, an experimental guideline (Table 1) can be sketched in order to appropriately exploit specific experimental techniques for: (1) optimizing NVs in size and shape; (2) improving the stability of the siRNA/NV complex; (3) characterizing the uptake and the release of the nanocomplex at the cellular level; (4) testing in vitro and in vivo gene silencing activity of the siRNA/NV system; and, finally, (5) assessing its toxicity profile.

<span style=color:blue>在过去十年中，关于纳米载体（NVs）作为siRNA递送系统的安全性、有效性和高效性的研究数量呈现指数增长。尤其是，含有正电氨基基团的PAMAM基础的CCD和ACD纳米载体，已成为形成高效siRNA递送系统的理想选择。在这方面，我们的研究团队在设计、合成、表征和测试共价和自组装纳米载体用于siRNA递送方面取得了显著进展。我们提出了一种分阶段的方法，控制这些纳米载体及其与核酸载体复合物的实验表征。基于这种方法，我们可以绘制出一份实验指南（表1），以便针对以下内容采用特定的实验技术：(1) 优化纳米载体的尺寸和形态；(2) 提高siRNA/纳米载体复合物的稳定性；(3) 表征纳米复合物在细胞水平的摄取和释放；(4) 测试siRNA/纳米载体系统的体外和体内基因沉默活性；(5) 最终，评估其毒性特征。</span>
