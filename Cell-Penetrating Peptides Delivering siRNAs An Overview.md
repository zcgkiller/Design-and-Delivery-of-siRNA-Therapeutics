# Cell-Penetrating Peptides Delivering siRNAs: An Overview

Luca Falato, Maxime Gestin and Ülo Langel

## Abstract

Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPP) are valuable tools capable of crossing the plasma membrane to deliver therapeutic cargo inside cells. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) are double-stranded RNA molecules capable of silencing the expression of a specific protein triggering the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, but they are unable to cross the plasma membrane and have a short half-life in the bloodstream. In this overview, we assessed the many different approaches used and developed in the last two decades to deliver siRNA through the plasma membrane through different CPPs sorted according to three different loading strategies: covalent conjugation, complex formation, and CPP-decorated (functionalized) nanocomplexes. Each of these strategies has pros and cons, but it appears the latter two are the most commonly reported and emerging as the most promising strategies due to their simplicity of synthesis, use, and versatility. Recent progress with siRNA delivered by CPPs seems to focus on targeted delivery to reduce side effects and amount of drugs used, and it appears to be among the most promising use for CPPs in future clinical applications.

## 1 Cell-Penetrating Peptides

### 1.1 Introducing Cell-Penetrating Peptides

Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are a group of linear and branched peptides that are usually between 5 and 30 residues and capable of passing through the plasma membrane. They can involve non-proteogenic amino acids (e.g., ornithine) or chemically modified residues in their structure that enhance endosomal escape, reduce degradation from endocytic proteases, and change the net charge, but their sequence is mainly composed of proteogenic amino acids. In addition to the main sequence, a polymer (e.g., PEG) or a fatty acid can be conjugated via a covalent bond to the peptide’s backbone to modify its physical-chemical properties. Some have a biological effect but they are mostly intended as carriers; in fact, they are capable of delivering therapeutic cargos through the plasma membrane.

CPPs have some standard features in common, such as positively charged residues (e.g., arginine and lysine) and amphipathicity. These physical-chemical properties and their distribution along the peptide molecule are associated with effects on the cellular machinery and the uptake mechanism, and thus they are usually used as a classifying method for CPPs. An alternative method of classification divides CPPs into groups according to the strategy used to conjugate the cargo and the carrier: peptides linked to the cargo by a covalent bond, and peptides stably complexed with it.

Despite significant research on CPPs, there are still some gray areas such as the uptake mechanism, discussed below. Currently, there are approximately 1850 CPPs available, but although the first clinical trial of a CPP was in 2000 and some are currently undergoing clinical trials for anticancer therapies, FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) approved CPP or CPP-related therapy are still lacking.

Among the reasons for this disparity between available peptides and lack of clinical trials are in vivo stability issues due to proteolytic degradation, immunogenicity, lack of specificity, and reduced efficiency due to the still not fully clarified uptake and endosomal escape mechanisms. For these reasons, recent research is focused on the development of more stable CPPs (e.g., using D-amino acids) and CPP-based nanoparticles capable of higher specificity and enhanced uptake.

### 1.2 Uptake Mechanisms and Endosomal Escape

Currently, the endocytosis is considered the primary uptake mechanism for CPPs (Fig. 1), and direct translocation is believed to be one of the possible internalization pathways depending on administration method and concentration.

**Fig. 1** Different uptake mechanisms of nanoparticles

Endocytosis is an energy-dependent mechanism usually divided into three distinct processes:

1. Caveolae-mediated endocytosis, as caveolae are considered to be a specialized and morphologically distinguishable form of lipid raft, and are a bulb-shaped invagination of the plasma membrane. These plasma membrane rafts are usually coated with receptors able to bind to lipid chains, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and class-A scavenger receptors (SCARA). The latter have been shown to have an essential part in caveolae-mediated uptake of several CPP:ON complexes.
2. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the process by which proteins and lipids are removed from the plasma membrane. Clathrin is a tri-legged structured protein characterized by the presence of three heavy and three light chains. Its shape allows it, when recruited, to deform the membrane within a cage-like structure consisting of 12 pentagons and a variable number of hexagons, forming an invagination that results in a “clathrin-coated vesicle.” The resulting intracellular vesicles go toward an un-coating process before fusing with endosomes. A recent paper reported that Syndecan-4, one of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans, is a primary cell surface target for arginine-rich peptides that lead to clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the CPP.
3. Macropinocytosis (MPC) consists of the uptake of extracellular material via the formation of protrusions or blebs extending from the cell membrane, folding backward around the particles and trapping them into macropinosomes. Macropinocytosis can be defined as a clathrin-independent form of endocytosis. The generation of the protrusion and the regulation of the macropinocytic flow has been the subject of recent intensive studies because of its importance in several diseases, such as the cell-to-cell transmission of prions, pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and cancer. MPC is very likely involved in CPPs uptake due to its capacity to enable the internalization of a large volume of extracellular fluid into cells. To confirm the relation between particle size and uptake mechanism, Nakase et al. recently reported enhanced uptake of extracellular vesicles decorated (functionalized) with arginine-rich CPPs by stimulation of macropinocytosis-related receptors.
4. A CPP:cargo complex, after entering the cell, can be entrapped in an endosome and degraded after the fusion with the lysosome. Currently, several strategies are available to promote endosomal escape, including (i) conjugating an agent that inhibits acidification of the endosome to the peptide, e.g., trifluoromethylquinoline, (ii) endowing the peptides of protonable moieties such as histidine, taking advantage of the “proton sponge effect”, (iii) stearylation, which has been shown to be a valuable strategy but is more effective on some peptides than others, (iv) synthesizing peptides that can change their secondary structure according to the pH, assuming an alpha-helix structure at the lower pH of the late endosomes, to destabilize the membrane. Algayer et al. reported an extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) study beginning at the INF7-Tat sequence. Despite efforts thus far, the structure/sequence-activity relation is not yet fully understood. Even the slightest change in the sequence, or the same modification on different peptides, such as stearylation, can considerably impact endosomal escape capacity and delivery effectiveness. 

## 2 Small Interfering RNA

### 2.1 A Brief Introduction to Small Interfering RNAs

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are a class of double-stranded RNA of 21 to 23 nucleotides with two overlapping nucleotides at the 3′ ends. They can virtually block the expression of any protein on a transcriptional level through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway by interaction with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) present in the cytoplasm. This complex escorts one preferentially loaded single strand RNA (guide strand) to the complementary mRNA and then an endonuclease present in the complex cleaves the target mRNA. An exogenous siRNA can be delivered in the cytoplasm, activating the RISC complex to silence a target mRNA. Currently, delivery of siRNAs into cells remains a primary obstacle to the full expression of potential siRNA therapies.

### 2.2 Delivery Methods

Small interfering RNAs are unable to cross the cell membrane or survive in the bloodstream without being immediately degraded. Therefore, to be protected and effective, they need a carrier. The most commonly employed vehicle in research today are liposomes, such as lipofectamine, which consists of positively charged liposomes able to form complexes with the negatively charged siRNA. Polymers of various lengths, such as polyethylene glycol, are, in some cases, conjugated covalently to the siRNA to shield it from degradation. Inorganic nanoparticles are also employed as delivery systems, e.g., metals, metal oxides, carbon material, nano-diamonds, and magnetic nanoparticles (super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles). Among the plethora of nanocarriers for siRNA delivery, peptides have gained popularity because of their structural and functional diversity. A broad variety of peptides can translocate siRNA into living cells via different pathways. CPPs can be used to deliver siRNA in cells in vitro and in vivo in the form of nanoparticles covalently conjugated or non-covalent complexes, and have recently been used to functionalize nanoparticles to enhance the uptake and the specificity of the delivery (Fig. 2).

## 3 Delivering siRNA Using CPPs: Three Strategies

### 3.1 CPP Covalently Conjugated to siRNA (CPP-siRNA)

An early strategy to covalently conjugate CPP to the siRNA utilized a covalent bond, which ensures proximity between the CPP and its cargo, prevents their separation in medium in vitro and in the bloodstream in vivo within a range of environmental conditions (presence or absence of certain enzymes and pH value), and potentially reduces the toxicity of the CPP due to the lower molar ratio needed. Most of the time, the CPP and its cargo are bonded together via a cleavable linker that allows the components to be separated in the cytoplasm and the siRNA to be recruited by the RISC complex, avoiding localization in the nucleus where it is ineffective. One of the most popular linkers for covalently conjugated CPP-siRNA is disulfide linkage, which is cleavable in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm, e.g., by glutathione. Muratovska et al. conjugated penetratin to siRNA via disulfide linkage and achieved downregulation of a luciferase reporter gene to a level comparable to cationic liposomes. A similar result was reported by Davidson et al..

On the other hand, the non-covalent complex penetratin:siRNA, despite good uptake, resulted in low downregulation due to entrapment in endosomes/lysosomes, because the peptide cannot show its endosomolytic properties when complexed with the cargo. However, when Moschos et al.  purified the covalently conjugated penetratin-siRNA (and TAT-siRNA) via HPLC, they achieved only moderate suppression of the reporter gene even at high concentrations of peptide, raising the possibility that the knockdown effect is induced by siRNA complexed with the CPP (instead of conjugated), These inconsistent results have yet to be fully clarified. It is noteworthy that binding the CPP (penetratin or Tat) to the 3′ instead of the 5′ end of the siRNA strand increased the downregulation effect. An interesting attempt was made by Chiu et al. to couple Tat to the 3′ end of an siRNA molecule through the non-cleavable linker SMPB (sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl) butyrate). The obtained result was a rapid uptake into cells, but a dot-like distribution of the labeled siRNA suggested that this was mainly inside endosomes, and therefore not available to the silencing pathway. Nevertheless, the reduced expression of the targeted gene was achieved. Further studies suggested that the reduced expression was probably due to the siRNA complexed with Tat rather than the siRNA covalently conjugated, since the peptide linked may cause steric hindrance problems to the RISC complex; further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. The penetratin-siRNA covalent approach was used on neuron cells (in vitro) and on the central nervous system (in vivo) by applying the treatment directly to the target tissue. This approach had lower toxicity on the cells compared with the liposome-based siRNA application strategy. However, it is not certain if the internalization and silencing effect can be attributed to the covalently conjugated or the complexed species because there was no purification step before testing. Furthermore, application directly on the tissue could not, of course, elucidate whether the treatment could pass through the blood-brain barrier. In addition to Tat and penetratin, Ye et al. and Yu et al. developed and then improved a covalent carrier using low molecular weight protamine (LMWP) conjugated to the siRNA molecule via a cytosol-cleavable disulfide linkage using PEG as spacer. None of our experimental attempts to deliver siRNA covalently bonded to a CPP via disulfide bond have been successful (unpublished results) despite the detection of uptake. Thus, the theoretical advantages of having the carrier covalently conjugated to the carrier are not reflected in practice given the prohibitive obstacles such as synthesis and purification. The majority of the results thus far demonstrate limited success in delivery , especially in vivo.

### 3.2 Non-covalent Complexes (CPP:siRNA) and Applications

The complex formation strategy for the CPP and siRNA is the commonly used; indeed, the overall cationic charge of the peptide and the anionic charge of the nucleotide make this strategy much easier to perform, and is cost effective since it does not require any reaction or purification compared to the covalent bond strategy.

The nature of the complex formation between the cationic CPPs and the anionic nucleic acid allows a versatile complex formulation using a simple “mix and incubate” technique at room temperature. However, incorporating the payload by electrostatic interaction can lead to instability and premature release of nucleic acid. To avoid this, a high density of positive charges is necessary to allow formation of stable complexes with a lower CPP concentration that will reduce toxic effects.

Delineating an optimal balance between peptide and siRNA, avoiding charge neutralization, and preserving a positive overall charge of the particle is mandatory to achieving uptake. Therefore, the structure of the CPP plays a crucial role in complex formation and stability. To circumvent possible charge neutralization of the CPP:siRNA complex, Endoh et al. developed a CPP by fusing U1A RNA binding protein to Tat peptide (TatU1A) that can only bind short hairpin RNA (shRNA) containing the U1A binding sequence. The complexes were able to enter the cells via endocytic pathway, and later photostimulation induced endosomal escape, allowing gene silencing. This strategy is termed CLIP-RNAi. Following the same path, Eguchi et al. developed PTD-DRBD, a Tat peptide fused with a single dsRNA binding domain(dsRBD ), and succeeded in silencing reporter genes even in difficult primary cell types (T cells, HUVECs, and hESCs) and in vivo. The dsRNA binding domain strategy was been widely studied by Tsui’s group between 2014 and 2015, synthesizing carriers using two and three CPPs fused to different DRBD domains deriving from Protein kinase R (PKR), Dicer and *E*. *coli* RNase (e.g., Hph1–Hph1-dsRBD and Tat-Tat-Tat-dsRBD) and obtaining efficient delivery of siRNA, inhibiting target gene expression with an efficiency comparable to Lipofectamine RNAi Max. Although complete binding of the siRNA required a ratio of 16:1, a slightly higher ratio of at least 20:1 was needed for effective delivery and silencing, perhaps because the two positively charged Hph1 might bind directly to the siRNA, causing a neutralization of the total charge.

As previously reported, the interaction between the RISC complex and siRNA is of primary importance to initiate the RNAi process, so the uptake of the complex (or conjugate) alone is not enough to achieve detectable gene silencing, and it is mandatory to promote the endosomal escape and the following release of the siRNA in the cytoplasm. EB1, a penetratin analog wherein some amino acids are replaced with histidine to induce an alpha helix structure after protonation in the acidic early-late endosomes, resulting in permeabilization of the endosomal membrane, was designed for this purpose.

PepFect6 , a stearyl-TP10 peptide (stearyl-transportan10), was designed with a pH-sensitive trifluoromethylquinoline moiety covalently incorporated in the side chain, taking advantage of the stearylation at the N′ terminus and the proton sponge effect to facilitate endosomal escape, obtaining stable RNAi responses in various cell types and in vivo (in liver). It has been reported that PepFect6 can successfully deliver even microRNAs (miRNAs) to suppress inflammation in a mouse model of irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) when pre-administered subcutaneously. MicroRNAs and silencing RNAs have similar physicochemical properties, but distinct functions. PepFect6 has been also used to develop a novel nanoparticle for siRNA delivery, as will be discussed later. Based on the PepFect6 experience, another CPP, PepFect14 (PF14) , was designed starting from the stearyl-TP10 peptide. It was built using ornithines as the main source of positive charges based on reports showing that poly-L-ornithine demonstrated superior transfection efficiency compared to equivalent poly-L-lysine-based systems relative to the ability to form more stable complexes at lower molar ratios, and on the hypothesis that ornithine might be less susceptible to proteases. Although this CPP was designed for splice correcting oligonucleotide (SCO) delivery, it has recently been used to successfully administer siRNA and was further modified with homing peptides to mediate selective transfection into glioblastoma cells.

NickFects are a family of branched peptides that were also developed from stearyl-TP10, modifying the sequence at Lys7 that acts as a linker between the neuropeptide galanin motif and mastoparan moiety of the peptide. NickFect70 (NF70) is a branched peptide derived from NickFect55, having a leucine substituted by an asparagine in the mastoparan region and the galanin motif substituted by a polyhistidine sequence. NF70 has three distinct segments: an N-terminal fatty acid moiety that is essential to enhance the formation of nanoparticles and stable complexes, an N-terminal hydrophobic/protonatable polyhistidine sequence that acts as a pH-sensitive switch for endosomal escape and may enhance nanoparticle accumulation in regions with lower pH (e.g., tumor tissues) in vivo*,* and a C-terminal cationic peptide. The use of NickFect70 to deliver siRNA successfully achieved gene knockdown both in vitro and in vivo.

CADY peptide was the first secondary amphipathic CPP, and is composed of 20 residues and designed as an siRNA carrier by Crombez et al. , including amino acids such as arginine and tryptophan to improve its interaction with siRNA and with the lipid phase of the cellular membrane. The spatial conformation of CADY improves its solubility and its interaction with siRNA. A maximal knockdown of 95% was reported with reduced or no cytotoxicity. CADY:siRNA complex uptake seems to occur primarily by direct translocation, as shown by the fact that it does not co-localize with the endocytotic markers. It has been found mainly in the cytoplasm and not in vesicles, as observed with electron microscopy, confirming that the knockdown effect of the complex is not affected by the presence of endocytotic inhibitors. CADY seems to induce temporary membrane disorganization long enough to pass through the membrane, followed by rapid resealing.

CADY-K is a CPP developed by Konate et al.  from the CADY sequence, as the name suggests, and showed a twofold increased knockdown of the target gene compared to the parental peptide. However, for the in vivo application, to avoid the degradation effects caused by extracellular and intracellular proteases, they developed a *retro-inverso* CADY K named RICK (***R***etro-***I***nverso  **C**ADY **K**)  that consists, in the reversed sequence, of D-amino acids instead of the L-isoforms. This strategy has been followed to obtain proteolytically stable peptide analogs that preserve the structural features essential to maintain the transfection properties of the peptide and the biological efficiency in vitro. Aldrian et al. reported the in vitro application of PEGylated RICK:siRNA complex, and also pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies in vivo (on mouse and zebrafish). However, in vivo RICK:siRNA-induced knockdown has not yet been reported in the literature.

Tat 49–57 (RKKRRQRRR)  opened the way for arginine-rich and homopolymers oligoarginine peptides. It was shown that oligoarginines can enter the cells more efficiently than other homopolymers and that the minimum length is around six residues. The most common length for oligoarginine peptides ranges between 7 and 9 residues. Exploiting the transfection proprieties of the polyarginine peptides in conjunction with the ability of hydrophobic moieties to compact the complexed carrier:cargo, CPP such as Chol-R9, a nonaarginine with a cholesteryl group conjugated to the N′ terminal, successfully delivered vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting siRNA, inhibiting the production of VEGF in CT-26 cells in vitro and suppressing tumor growth in vivo. Similarly, stearyl-R8 complexed with siRNA reportedly efficiently reduced expression of the target gene in primary mammalian neurons with low toxicity, especially compared to commercial transfection agents such as Lipofectamine.

In the last few years, a new stearylated peptide, STR-KV (STR-HHHKKKVVVVVV) has been developed and shown to cross the plasma membrane through a direct translocation pathway, achieving an 80% to 87% gene knockdown in three different cell lines. Huang et al. reported the use of a bifunctional peptide based on the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif affinity for the integrin αvβ3, highly expressed in tumor cells and neovascular endothelial cells, and the polyarginine R10. The bifunctional CPP is called RGD10-R10 where RGD10 is a cyclic RGD peptide that exhibits a higher affinity for αvβ3 than its linear version. RGD10-R10 showed a stronger siRNA binding capacity than naked R10, likely compromising the efficiency of siRNA effect. Indeed, in vivo experiments showed cellular internalization and tumor accumulation, but a low silencing effect in vitro that was likely due to a lack of endosomal escape or the failure of the complex to release the siRNA.

To enhance complex formation and trigger siRNA release inside the reducing environment cytoplasm, Tanaka et al. used a stearylated CPP, STR-CH2R4H2C (R: arginine, C: cysteine, H: histidine), wherein the cysteine’s thiol group is intended to stabilize the complexes by disulfide bonds between peptides, which is cleaved once inside the cell. A reduction of tumor growth after delivering siRNA for VEGF by direct tumor injection in mice was achieved. The CPP and siRNA complexes were obtained by simply mixing the two components at room temperature at different ratios and checking the degree of disulfide linkage in complexes using an Ellman’s reagent assay. The complexes were prepared by air oxidation to avoid excessive cross linkage that could decrease the release of siRNA from the carrier once in the cytoplasm.

To enhance the selectivity of a CPP, it can be equipped with a moiety that inhibits its ability to permeate the plasma membrane unless under certain environmental conditions. Indeed, the so-called “activatable CPPs” (aCPPs) are usually CPPs that expose their cationic domain only under certain conditions. Li et al.  used this strategy to deliver a plasmid encoding for the siRNA that targets human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) to reduce cell proliferation and inhibit cell growth. They used an activatable CPP (EEEEEEE-GALGLP-RRRRRRRRKKR) equipped with a polyglutamic acid domain able to neutralize the cationic charges of arginine/lysine sequence connected by a domain cleavable by the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2). MMPs are the most well-known proteases overexpressed by tumors, and most malignant tumors express MMP2. They succeeded in delivering the plasmid, which could occur only after cleavage of the polyglutamic acid, achieving a lower expression of hTERT. Despite the appeal of the “activatable” strategy, the delivery of proper siRNA by aCPPs is rarely reported.

The ability of a peptide to “distinguish” where or which kind of cells to enter seems to be mandatory for therapeutic application. Targeted delivery of siRNAs would reduce the amount of required drug, minimizing off-target effects. There are many examples of CPPs conjugated to antibodies to enhance the specificity of the delivery of the siRNA. Song et al. used the heavy chain Fab fragment of an HIV-1 envelope antibody fused to protamine (F105-P) to deliver siRNA specifically to cells expressing HIV-1 envelope via intravenous injection in mice. They went even further using an anti-ErbB2-protamine fusion protein to deliver siRNAs specifically to breast cancer cells. Penetratin:siRNA nanoparticles coated with hyaluronic acid (HA) have been developed as antiatherosclerotic therapy. These nanoparticles take advantage of the overexpression of CDD44 receptor by impaired endothelial cells and its affinity for the HA coating, which allows localization of the nanoparticles (NPs) in proximity to atherosclerotic lesions. Subsequently, the NPs diffuse through the permeable endothelium via the gaps between injured endothelial cells losing their HA coating due to the HAase within the plaques exposing the CPP:siRNA to the foam cells. These HA-coated NPs showed effective gene delivery into atherosclerotic plaques in vivo with an antiatherogenic efficacy dependent on HA molecular weight and coating density.

Homing peptides are molecules that can bind to specific sites in the vasculature in vivo. Screening for tumor homing peptides has produced a broad collection of peptides that localize in tumor tissues and that can be fused to CPPs and used to “aim” them at a specific tissue.

Kumar and coworkers employed a short peptide derived from rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG), which can bind to the acetylcholine receptor expressed by neuronal cells, fused to a nonaarginine peptide (RVG-9R), and succeeded in RNAi silencing in vitro and in vivo after intravenous injection in mice. RVG-9R delivered siRNA to the neuronal cells, resulting in specific gene silencing within the brain. The same group performed an extensive study of siRNA transfection using nonaarginine (L and D) conjugated with different targeting ligands, evaluating the efficiency of transfection, mRNA knockdown, and uptake mechanism.

In 2014, Youn et al. reported a myristic acid-conjugated transportan (TP)  equipped with a transferrin receptor-targeting peptide (myr-TP-Tf) that led to stable encapsulation and targeted delivery of functioning siRNA to brain endothelial cells, glioma cells, and across a model brain endothelial cell monolayer. Despite these encouraging results, and the development of novel CPP projected for targeted delivery, the use of siRNA in this area is rarely reported.

### 3.3 CPP-Decorated Multifunctional Nanocomplexes for siRNA Delivery

Over the last few years, the number of reported siRNA delivery methods using combinations of CPPs and other carriers has increased. These decorated multifunctional nanocomplexes were developed to enhance selectivity, half-life in the bloodstream, and, more general, as a versatile tool exploiting the characteristics of several compounds simultaneously. Kang et al. used two different CPPs concurrently in the same delivery system. They modified their previously reported micelle-like nanoparticle (MNP) , named PLPEI, which is composed of a polyethylenimine (PEI) moiety that drives the formation of a dense polyplex core and a phospholipid (PL) moiety forming a surrounding lipid barrie. The replacement of the PEI moiety with a nonaarginine (R9) led to the so-called lipid-peptide hybrid nanoparticles (hNP) that are able to complex and carry oligonucleotides. The hNP has been further modified with Tat 48–60 to enhance cellular transfection (T-hNP). This last formulation has been reported to have a better accumulation in tumor tissue in vivo (mouse model), lasting for 72 h, and a better gene silencing effect.

Harashima’s group in 2007, after screening different polycations, developed a stearylated octaarginine multifunctional envelope-type nano device  (R8-MEND) that inhibited luciferase activity more than 80% in HeLa cells expressing luciferase, showing minimal cytotoxicity. This delivery system has been developed even further via surface modification using GALA, a pH-sensitive fusogenic peptide that permits enhanced endosomal escape in response to the low pH in endosomes, and small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) that improve the intracellular uncoating, allowing RNA interference. The R8:GALA-MENDSUV showed more efficient gene knockdown than the regular R8:GALA-MEND in HeLa cells expressing GFP. R8:GALA-MENDSUV successfully reduced the expression of the suppressor of the cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) gene in primary mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Subsequently, the same group upgraded the R8-MEND system by equipping it with a PEG-peptide-lipid ternary conjugate (PEG-Peptide-DOPE conjugate (PPD)), which acts as a PEG-shield cleavable by the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the tumor tissue environment. After some optimization of the PEGylation ratio to find a balance between circulation time and silencing activity, the PPD-MEND accumulated in tumors and exhibited silencing activity, showing no hepatotoxicity and no immune system stimulation in vivo. Taking advantage of the mildly acidic pH in the tumor microenvironment, Xiang et al.  developed and characterized an activatable CPP-liposome-based siRNA delivery system. The DSPE-PEG2000 liposomes were decorated with an activatable CPP (DSPE-PEG2000-ACPP) composed of an octaarginine peptide connected to a polyanionic “shielding domain” composed of glutamate and histidine by means of an acid-labile linker (hydrazone). When exposed to the physiological pH (7.4), the cationic moiety of the CPP is “hidden” by the intramolecular electrostatic interaction with the glutamate in the polyanionic moiety, whereas when exposed to the lower microenvironmental pH of the tumor tissue, the linker is cleaved and the histidine in the “shielding domain” is protonated so the octaarginine is free to interact at the plasma membrane, allowing the modified liposomes to pass through and deliver the siRNA cargo.

In 2010, Xiong et al. successfully developed a virus mimetic polymeric micelle for siRNA-targeted delivery based on poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) micelles decorated with integrin αvβ3 targeting peptide (RGD4C) and Tat peptide, and modified with a polycation (spermine) in the PCL core to bind and protect the siRNA. They also tested micelles decorated with just RGD4C or Tat, but the efficient cellular uptake and endosomal escape were observed only in the micelles possessing both peptides at the same time. Tat peptide was similarly used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in the PCM-poly(CBA-DAH)-Tat polyplex developed by Nem et al. as a nonviral carrier for siRNA. Primary cardiomyocyte-specific peptide (PCM) has been used together with Tat and incorporated to the cystamine bisacrylamide-diaminohexane (CBA-DAH) polymer to achieve targeted siRNA transfection in cardiomyocytes, suppressing SHP-1 and Fas expression and decreasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

An interesting approach and results were achieved by Kim’s group starting from a simple nonaarginine peptide. They used a stepwise process of troubleshooting to overcome all the different barriers that the siRNA need to pass through to be effective. To solve the lack of specificity of the polyarginine peptide, it was fused with the tumor-homing peptide I4R, obtaining I4R-9r. They blended a small amount of an endosomolytic tandem peptide (sHGP-9r) with I4R-9r to enhance endosomal escape, and substituted alanine residues for one or more arginines along the polyarginine peptide sequence to determine the optimal balance between complex formation and cargo release in the cytoplasm. The final result was efficient gene silencing in vitro and in vivo by this so-called multicomponent peptide-woven siRNA nanocomplex (PwSN). A similar result was achieved by means of the previously described PF6, which was used to form complexes with siRNA that were loaded in lipid membrane capsules decorated with PF6 (PF6/PF6-NP). The potent RNA interference effect shown in vitro was likely achieved due to the high cellular uptake, the formation of loose complexes, and the facilitated endosomal escape due to the bulky quinoline moiety of PF6.

An interesting approach to target delivery in vivo is “ultrasound-mediated.” The application of ultrasound directly to the tumor tissue might trigger cargo delivery by some specifically designed carriers. One of the first steps in this direction was made by Ren et al., who wanted to selectively deliver pDNA in vivo by means of Tat peptide used to form the non-covalent complex with a pDNA that could adhere to the PEG4000 on the nanobubble surface. Later, searching for an “off-on” switch for nanocarriers, Xie et al. reported the development and use in vitro and in vivo of siRNA covalently conjugated to a CPP derived from penetratin, trapped in ultrasound-sensitive nanobubbles or nano-sized echogenic liposomes ((CPP-siRNA)-NB). They achieved efficient tumor accumulation of labeled siRNA exposed to ultrasound, accompanied by reduced liver accumulation, after systemic administration, and reduced tumor growth in vivo (in mice) compared to the “naked” CPP-siRNA and (CPP-siRNA)-NB not exposed to ultrasounds. The same penetratin-derived CPP covalently bonded to its siRNA cargo has been used in a dual stimulus delivery strategy based on the presence of homing peptide-decorated liposomes and hyperthermia. Higher accumulation and reduced tumor growth were reported after transfection of c-myc siRNA via CPP-siRNA conjugate encapsulated into thermosensitive liposomes (TSL) modified with homing moiety on the surface, compared to CPP-siRNA alone and the unheated CPP-siRNA/TSL.

Another strategy to “aim” at the tumor tissue via external stimulation is the use of a magnetic field and magnetic nanoparticles of Fe3O4 as carriers. Qi et al. modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an amphipol polymer and a protamine peptide to form cell-penetrating magnetic nanoparticles (CPMNs), and reported eGFP expression suppressed to 12% in vitro under an applied external magnetic field. Recently, Ben Djemaa et al. reported the development of a siRNA delivery system based on PEGylated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) functionalized with gH625 peptide, chitosan, and poly-L-arginine. In this strategy, SPIONs are intended to serve as scaffolding, and the PEG as a “shield” in the bloodstream, wherein the cationic peptide should enhance complex formation with the siRNA and the endosomal escape and gH625 should guarantee internalization through the plasma membrane. They reported an efficient downregulation of eGFP in vitro and, with further studies, expanded on the role gH625 may play in endosomal escape as well as in the internalization step in a triple-negative breast cell line.

To use different triggers at the same time, a photo-pH-responsive polypeptide (PPP) , used to decorate poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, has been developed and its selective siRNA transfection capacity has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The PPP is composed of three different elements: a penetratin-derived CPP, a photo-degradable group (4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl), and a pH-sensitive inhibitory peptide. The idea behind this system is to expose the tumor site to near infrared (NIR) to cleave the photo-degradable group and exploit the lower pH of the tumor environment to expose the CPP, which will be free to transfect the nanoparticle through the plasma membrane and deliver the siRNA in the cytoplasm. Accumulation and reduced tumor growth has been reported in a mouse model using this dual-stimuli responsive nanoparticle system.

## 4 Conclusions

In this overview, many ideas to develop and apply different siRNA delivery methods using CPPs have been reported (Table 1). These two promising technologies and the current lack of clinical applications suggest that their combined use might overcome their individual shortcomings (Fig. 3). Similarly, developing multifunctional nanoparticles that exploit CPPs, polymers, lipids, antibodies at the same time and any other tool to protect and selectively deliver siRNA seems to be the right path to follow to finally develop a clinically efficient RNA interference-based therapy. Given the fundamental role of CPPs in passing through the plasma membrane, more research is needed to increase the number of available peptides, to fully understand their mechanisms of uptake and endosomal escape to achieve a complete picture of their possibilities and limitations and thus identify the best CPP, or CPPs to most effectively deliver the cargo for the given conditions until full clinical application.
