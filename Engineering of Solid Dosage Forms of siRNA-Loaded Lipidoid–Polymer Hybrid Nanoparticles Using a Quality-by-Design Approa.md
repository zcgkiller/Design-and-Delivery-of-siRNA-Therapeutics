## Abstract

Therapy based on RNA interference (RNAi), which can be mediated by exogenous small interfering RNA (siRNA), has potential for the management of diseases at the genetic level by silencing gene function(s). In all eukaryotic cells, RNAi is an endogenous regulatory mechanism, where messenger RNA (mRNA) is degraded, preventing its translation into protein. A significant advantage of RNAi therapy is that siRNA is very potent and gene silencing is highly specific, ensuring few off-target effects. However, the delivery of exogenous siRNA to the RNAi pathway in the cytosol is a challenge, and there is a need for development of advanced delivery systems to ensure safe and effective delivery of siRNA to the intracellular target site. Recently, we demonstrated the ability of lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) composed of cationic lipidoid 5 (L5) and the biodegradable polymer poly(dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid) to effectively deliver siRNA directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) intracellularly to macrophages. L5 is a novel lipid-like material consisting of a tetraamine backbone linked to five C12 alkyl chains. Here, we describe a systematic quality-by-design (QbD) approach including risk assessment and design of experiments to investigate the influence of critical formulation parameters (i.e., L5 content and L5:TNF-α siRNA ratio (w/w)) on the physicochemical properties and the TNF-α gene silencing ability of TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPNs, prepared by using a double emulsion solvent evaporation method. We then detail protocols for the manufacturing of more stable solid dosage forms of LPNs using freeze drying and spray drying processes, respectively. We also provide protocols for characterization of the physicochemical properties of the nanocomposite dry powders, including (1) process yield, (2) aerodynamic particle size, (3) surface morphology, (4) moisture content, and (5) solid state properties. General considerations are provided that emphasize the advantages and disadvantages of applying QbD approaches for optimizing nanoparticulate formulations.

## 1 Introduction

Development of new therapeutics to treat diseases remains a constant challenge. RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutics represent promising alternative treatment options when traditional small-molecule drugs or/and peptide/protein-based therapy fail. Moreover, the use of RNAi-based strategies may overcome issues of drug resistance prevalent with traditional therapeutics. RNAi is an endogenous defense and regulatory mechanism based on posttranscriptional gene regulation that is mediated by small RNA duplexes, including microRNA (miRNA), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). By exploiting this pathway, exogenous siRNAs can be applied to silence the expression of virtually any gene, including targets which have traditionally been considered as undruggable. However, one of the key challenges associated with the successful realization of siRNA-based therapeutics is the requirement for safe and effective delivery approaches. To enter the RNAi pathway, siRNA has to be delivered into the cytosol of target cells, where it is incorporated into the RNAi machinery. However, unmodified siRNA is chemically unstable under physiological conditions, can be immunogenic, and does not readily cross cell membranes. Therefore, siRNA duplexes are usually chemically modified to increase the half-life and reduce undesired immunogenicity. Chemical conjugation of siRNA to biomolecules, e.g., cell-penetrating peptides, antibodies, lipids, or *N*-acetyl galactosamine, may (1) enable target-specific delivery, (2) improve serum stability, and (3) increase transfection efficiency. Alternatively, delivery systems may also be used to facilitate permeation of the large and hydrophilic siRNA molecules across the cell membrane into the cytosol. An example is the recently approved siRNA-based therapeutic ONPATTRO™ (Patisiran), which is an siRNA formulation based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) used for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. In addition, a plethora of delivery systems are under exploration for ensuring safe in vivo delivery of siRNA, including lipid-based delivery systems, polymer-based delivery systems, and lipid-polymer hybrid systems. We have designed a novel delivery system based on lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) for efficient and safe delivery of siRNA into the cytosol, and we recently demonstrated the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of LPNs loaded with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) siRNA for the treatment of experimental inflammation. These LPNs consist of two main components: lipidoid and poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Lipidoids belong to a novel class of cationic lipid-like materials that efficiently interact with polyanionic nucleic acids including siRNA via attractive electrostatic interactions and mediate cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and cytosolic delivery. PLGA forms the polymeric core of the LPNs allowing sustained release of siRNA and thus constitutes an inherent part of the LPN architecture. The lipidoid component interacts with the PLGA core and may form a membrane shell structure around the core. The cationic lipidoid headgroup neutralizes the anionic charge of the nucleic acid cargo, e.g., siRNA, while the hydrophobic alkyl chains play a role in cell membrane fusion. These LPNs can be prepared by using a multi-step double emulsion solvent evaporation method that enables efficient encapsulation of water-soluble and polyanionic compounds, e.g., siRNA. We have previously reported a detailed protocol for this method and identified critical formulation parameters (CFPs) and critical process parameters (CPPs). In this chapter, we detail methods for (1) quality-by-design (QbD)-based optimization of TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPNs using risk assessment and design of experiments (DoE), (2) manufacturing of solid dosage forms of LPNs applying freeze drying and spray drying processes, respectively, and (3) physicochemical characterization of the spray-dried nanocomposite LPN microparticles.

Applying QbD approaches in the design, development, and manufacturing of medicines ensures the quality of pharmaceuticals by employing statistical, analytical, and risk management methodologies. Such approaches help in identifying significant sources of variability that may affect formulations and processes and aid in meeting the desired characteristics. Thus, applying these principles in the design of an LPN formulation that displays optimal siRNA encapsulation efficiency and loading, balanced cytotoxic and gene silencing profiles, desired physicochemical properties, and stability ensures a robust formulation and a high-quality product. Hence, QbD is a logical and stepwise process (Fig. 1) involving the following principles: (1) risk assessment, (2) identification of the quality target product profile (QTPP), i.e., the product attributes that are critical to stability, safety, and efficacy, (3) identification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) based on the product, the process, and the QTPP, (4) screening of CFPs/CPPs to identify potential risk variables, (5) design of the process to deliver product and process attributes (CQAs and QTPP), (6) identification of a robust control strategy that ensures consistent formulation/process performance, and (7) validation of the formulation/process to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy and to evaluate if the product formulated/processed within the identified optimal operating space (OOS) meets the QTPP.

Pulmonary administration is promising for the local delivery of target-specific siRNA in the treatment of lung diseases, e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), because systemic degradation and poor lung targeting associated with dosing via the oral and intravenous routes, respectively, are circumvented. Local delivery into the lungs may enable dose reduction, reduce systemic side effects, and avoid first past metabolism. However, several challenges are associated with pulmonary delivery, including the intrinsic barriers in the lungs, constraints related to dosage forms, e.g., the aerodynamic particle properties, and the complex immunopathogenesis of the disease, e.g., COPD. For pulmonary delivery, solid dosage forms are preferred for macromolecules and nanoparticles because they are cheaper, possess prolonged shelf-life, and do not require the so-called cold-chain, as compared to liquid dosage forms. Processes frequently used to manufacture solid dosage forms include freeze drying and spray drying. The siRNA-loaded nanoparticles are suspended in a solution containing a stabilizing excipient, e.g., mannitol or trehalose, and lyophilized, resulting in microparticles in which the nanoparticles are embedded. During spray drying, the liquid LPN dispersion containing stabilizing excipient(s) is aerosolized and dried, allowing for the engineering of microparticles with a specific mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), which dictates lung deposition. We have identified a stabilizer and optimized spray drying parameters critical for the design of inhalable solid dosage forms of TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPNs. In addition to the MMAD, a number of other physicochemical properties of the dry powder determine the aerosol performance, lung deposition, and ultimately the therapeutic efficacy of the cargo, and they include particle shape, surface morphology, moisture content, and crystallinity. Here, we describe protocols for measuring these solid state properties using spray-dried, TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPNs.

## 3 Methods

### 3.1 Design of Experiment (DoE)

To design and set up the experiment, the Design Expert® program is used. An Ishikawa or fishbone diagram is utilized for risk assessment (Fig. 1A) . To design a TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPN formulation with the desired physicochemical properties and in vitro performance, the QTPP is defined (Fig. 1B) based on the CQAs (Fig. 1C, Table 2). The process parameters (Fig.1D) are kept constant because the processes related to LPN preparation have been optimized previously. Based on previous data, the L5 content is varied at three levels (15–25%, w/w), while the L5:TNF-α siRNA weight ratio is varied at four levels from 15:1 to 5:1 (Table 3, Fig. 1E, *see* **Note** **1**). The response surface DoE used in the experiments represents a randomized, I-optimal (*see* **Note** **2**), custom design (Fig. 2) to accommodate two continuous numeric factors [the L5 content (%, w/w) and the L5:TNF-α siRNA weight ratio] where no categorical factors are varied (Table 3) for a total of 12 design points. These points are replicated with one additional design point so that the total number of runs is 25. A total of seven responses to the CFPs are measured. It is recommended to use the highest order models, which are not aliased to fit the data, and in this case, it is quadratic (*see* **Note** **3**).

Workflow for using Design-Expert® in response surface methodology for optimizing the loading of siRNA into LPNs

#### 3.1.1 Statistical Model Optimization

1. The model is evaluated using prediction-based metrics via Fraction of Design Space (FDS) statistics because the goal for optimization is to maximize the predictability of the responses rather than screening (Table 4). The standard error of mean (SEM) should be as low as possible in a maximal FDS (Fig. 3a). In this case, the SEM is 0.479 in 95% of the design space (Fig. 3b), which is in agreement with the guidelines recommended by Stat-Ease Inc. 
2. The next step is to analyze the responses to the CFPs using analysis of variance (ANOVA), which can be found on the left panel of Design-Expert® under the title “Analysis” and then responses. For the sake of simplicity, only one response (the zeta potential) is described in this protocol (Fig. 4a). A detailed explanation of these values can be found in the program under the ANOVA section. 
3. The predicted *R*2 value of 0.962 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted *R*2 of 0.979, i.e., the difference is less than 0.2 (Fig. 4b, Table 5). The adequate precision is a measure for the signal-to-noise ratio. A ratio larger than four is desirable. A ratio of 42.93 indicates an adequate signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, this model can be used to navigate through the design space. 
4. From the above results, it is evident that the zeta potential is significantly affected by the CFPs and that the model is valid for navigation throughout the design space (*see* **Note** **4**).

#### 3.1.2 Determining the Optimal Operating Space

The optimal operating space (OOS) represents the part of the experimental design space where the criteria defined by the QTPP are met (Fig. 5a). The OOS is identified by separately modeling all the responses, as explained above, and then utilizing a numerical and graphical optimization tool, which can be found in the Design-Expert® program under the heading “Optimization” under Analysis. The criteria can be modified according to the desired responses and characteristics of the LPNs (Fig. 1F). As examples, the zeta potential and polydispersity index (PDI) are modeled. Modeling of the former results in numerous solutions based on the input and the desired range, followed by assigning a desirability score (0 to 1) to the combination of CFPs (Fig. 5b). The desirability score should not necessarily be high because it depends on how well the agreement is between the input and the desired numbers, rather than the absolute value. A graphical optimization plot (Fig. 5a) is a semiquantitative overlay plot of the OOS superimposed on the original design space, providing a visual representation that can be adjusted graphically by changing contour lines (*see* **Note** **5**).

Red circles represent experimental data points in duplicates

#### 3.1.3 Constructing the Plots

1. For all responses, analyze the data by ANOVA using the highest order model that is not aliased. 
2. Set the desired lower and upper values for the responses found under the criteria tab. In this case, the target is a zeta potential in the range of 15–30 mV, while for the PDI, the lower value is set to 0.0 with an upper limit of 0.15 (*see* **Note** **6**). 
3. Combine all responses by clicking on solutions, which provide a numerical point value of the CFPs where all the responses meet the pre-set criteria. 
4. Under the “Graphs” tab, select the response as desirability and change the graph type to contour plots. 
5. The region shaded toward the red (Fig. 5b) represents the optimal L5 content and L5:TNF-α siRNA weight ratio where both responses (zeta potential and PDI) display the desired values (*see* **Note** **7**). The edge of failure is the boundary between the blue region and the other colored regions, where either one or more responses do not fulfill the set criteria (Fig. 1G). 
6. The overlay plot can be constructed by selecting Graphical Optimization and entering the desired values. The black contour lines on the graph can be adjusted to visualize how the responses affect the operating space. 

### 3.2 Freeze Drying

The liquid TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPN dispersions are freeze-dried using trehalose as the stabilizing excipient.

1. For each 2 mL LPN batch, place a total of three glass vials in a laminar flow cabinet. 
2. Add 1.67 mL 10% (w/v) trehalose solution and 1.67 mL LPN dispersion to each glass vial and mix several times by pipetting. The total volume is 3.34 mL (*see* **Note** **8**). 
3. Carefully transfer 1.1 mL of the mixture to the bottom of the remaining three vials (*see* **Note** **9**). 
4. Insert RNase-free butyl rubber caps partially onto the necks of the vials to allow the water to evaporate during the freeze-drying cycle. 
5. Carefully place the filled glass vials on a pre-cooled shelf (+5 °C) of the freeze dryer. 
6. Close the door and the aeration valve of the freeze dryer and run the program (Table 6). 
7. After completion of the program, close the vials entirely by turning the vial stoppering device. 
8. Repressurize the freeze dryer slowly with atmospheric air by partially opening the aeration valve. 
9. After complete repressurization, remove the freeze-dried LPNs and store them at 4 °C.

### 3.3 Spray Drying

The liquid dispersions of TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPNs are spray dried using mannitol as stabilizing excipient. The dry powder LPN microparticles are separated from the airstream by centrifugal forces using a high-performance cyclone. The spray drying settings used are as follows: a feed flow rate 0.3 mL/min, an outlet temperature of 50 °C, an aspirator capacity of 90%, and an atomizing airflow of 742 L/h.

#### 3.3.1 Preparation of the Feedstock Dispersion for Spray Drying

1. The total volume of the feedstock dispersion should be 10 mL. In the 10 mL volume, the total solid content, i.e., the LPNs and mannitol, should be 250 mg out of which the LPNs constitutes 5% (w/w). This corresponds to 12.5 mg LPNs and 237.5 mg mannitol. 
2. In a glass container, pipette 4.75 mL mannitol solution (5% w/v), 1.67 mL LPN dispersion, and 3.58 mL DEPC-treated water. Pipette up and down to mix. 

#### 3.3.2 The Spray Drying Process

1. Assemble the spray drying chamber, the two-fluid nozzle, the feed tube, the connectors, the cyclone separator, and the collection vial. 
2. Connect the outlet of the spray dryer to the dehumidifier. 
3. Before turning on the spray dryer, ensure that the atomizing gas (nitrogen) inlet valve is open, the dehumidifier is turned on, and that proper ventilation systems are in place.
4. Switch on and configure the spray dryer: set the atomization airflow to 742 L/h (corresponds to 60 mm on the Q-flow indicator), the inlet temperature to 70 °C, and the aspirator capacity to 90%. The desired outlet temperature of 50 °C is achieved with the above configuration, when the peristaltic pump is set to 5%. 
5. Turn on the inlet temperature, the aspirator, and the peristaltic pump. When the inlet temperature rises above 40 °C, start pumping in MilliQ water. 
6. When the inlet and outlet temperatures are stabilized at the predefined values, remove the feed tube from the MilliQ water and put it in the glass vial containing the LPN dispersion. 
7. After the LPNs are spray-dried, place the feed tube in the MilliQ water to rinse the system for any remaining product. 
8. Turn off the aspirator, the pump, the air inlet valve, and the dehumidifier, followed by disassembly of the individual parts. All parts should be washed and dried with compressed air. 
9. The powder in the collection vial can be collected by scraping the walls with a soft spatula (*see* **Note** **10**). 

#### 3.3.3 Powder Yield

The powder yield is measured as the weight difference between the collected powder compared and the initial total solid content of the dispersions before spray drying. It is calculated as the weight difference of the collection vial before and after spray drying divided by the initial total solid content of the dispersions (Eq. 1).

### 3.4 Moisture Content

The residual moisture content in the dry powders is determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) after heating approximately 10 mg of the samples at a constant rate of 30 °C/min up to 300 °C The water loss caused by evaporation is calculated in percent and defined as the moisture content.

#### 3.4.1 Sample Preparation and Loading

1. In case the pans are reusable, burn them for a few seconds with an oxidizing flame and remove the charred residue, if any, with a soft-bristled brush. 
2. Handle the pans by the bow with a blunt tweezer. 
3. Place the cleaned pans in the autosampler and note the direction in which they are placed (*see* **Note** **11**). 
4. In the TRIOS program, calibrate the weight of the pans using the tare function. 
5. Note down the pan numbers in the autosampler and select the pans that should be calibrated. 
6. Carefully remove the pans from the autosampler and fill them with approximately 15 mg spray-dried LPN powder, which will cover the bottom of the pans (*see* **Note** **12**). 
7. Place the pans in the autosampler in the same position as they were tared. 
8. Navigate to “Experiments” in the software and create a new experiment. 
9. Set up the experiment with a temperature range from 30 to 300 °C and a ramp of 30 °C/min and start the experiment. 
10. After the experiment, allow the instrument to cool down. 
11. Data can be analyzed by clicking on Results and opening the experiment file. 
12. Right-click on the curve where the weight is 100%, click on Analyze, and then Weight change. 
13. Drag the black, cross-haired circle to a point just after the drop in weight at around 120 °C and accept the change. 
14. At this temperature, the weight change in the sample can be attributed to the loss of moisture (Fig. 6).

### 3.5 Aerodynamic Particle Size

The MMAD of the spray-dried powders is measured using an aerodynamic particle sizer.

1. Adjust the air capillary flow rate to 5 L/min. 
2. Place the spray-dried powders on the sample disc and gently spread the powders with the supplied soft-bristle brush at appropriately spaced positions. 
3. Carefully dock the sample disc on the turntable, direct the tube on the sample path, set the rotation rate to 7, clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW). 
4. Create a new experiment, save the data file, and start data collection. 
5. Note down the results from the statistics table and save the aerodynamic diameter graph. Figure [7](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_9_Chapter.xhtml#Fig7) shows a population distribution of particles displaying an aerodynamic diameter 1–6 μm and an MMAD 3.3 μm.

The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) was estimated to be approximately 3.3 μm

### 3.6 Surface Morphology

The morphology of the spray-dried particles is examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, a working distance of 5.8 mm, and an emission current of 53,500 mA.

#### 3.6.1 Sample Preparation and Loading

1. Place a double-sided conductive carbon adhesive tape on the stub making sure to secure it firmly. 
2. With the help of a metal spoon, sprinkle the powder on the carbon tape (*see* **Note****13**). 
3. Gently tap the stub on a hard surface to remove excess powder. 
4. Lift the lid of the surface coating chamber, remove the glass tube, transfer the stub, which has the sample on it to the plate inside the chamber, put the glass tube back to its position, and close the lid of the chamber. 
5. Switch on the sputter coater. In the “Auto” mode, press the “Cycle” button until the display shows “20,” and start the coater (*see* **Note** **14**). 
6. Switch off the coater and remove the stub when the chamber is repressurized (*see* **Note** **15**). 

#### 3.6.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy

1. Run the TM3030 software and evacuate the microscope (Note the blue LED for EVAC/AIR). 
2. When the sample is ready, repressurize the system and open the sample chamber. 
3. Place the stub on the specimen holder by screwing it to the stick followed by placing the specimen holder on the black stage. 
4. Adjust the height of the specimen holder by loosening the two screws that hold them at the bottom. Tighten the screws once the position is fixed (*see* **Note** **16**). 
5. Place the specimen holder in the microscope chamber. Adjust the position in such a way that the crosshair (+) is aligned with the tip of the triangle. Evacuate the chamber and capture the data. 
6. Set the observation view, magnification, adjust brightness and contrast, autofocus the image, and select slow scanning speed. 
7. Capture the image when it is wholly focused and stop data acquisition (Fig. 8). 
8. Take out the sample after repressurizing the chamber.

### 3.7 Solid State Properties

The solid state properties of the dry powders are characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD).

#### 3.7.1 Sample Preparation and Loading

1. Turn on the X-Ray Powder Diffractometer and start the program “Data Collector.” 
2. Create a new program with an absolute scan, change the detector value to X’Celerator, enter the details as shown in Table [7](clbr://internal.invalid/OEBPS/html/485053_1_En_9_Chapter.xhtml#Tab7), and save the program. 
3. On the instruments tab toward the left of the screen, double-click on Sample Changer: Changer PW3065/00 (15 positions) and click on Reset button. 
4. In the same tab, head over to X-ray tab and enter 45 kV for tension and 10 mA for the current. 
5. Distribute the spray-dried TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPNs and mannitol evenly on the aluminum sample holders. 
6. Load the sample holders into the magazine. The positions are numbered from 1 to 15 (top to bottom). 
7. Place the magazine in the sample changer such that the two alignment holes at the bottom go directly into the alignment pins. 
8. The numbered side should face toward the operator, i.e., toward the glass door, away from the goniometer. 
9. Adjust the power of the generator to 45 kV and 40 mA. 
10. Open the program, click on Measure, select the saved program, and click OK to start the measurement. 
11. Ensure that the shutter is closed, turn down the voltage to 40 kV, and the current to 10 mA. 
12. Run the X’Pert High Score Plus program and open the XRDML file. 
13. Click on the Treatment tab and determine the background. 
14. Subtract the background and accept the changes. 
15. The diffractograms can be exported as they are. The anchor scan data can be copied, if needed, to plot in other programs. 
16. Diffractograms from the two sample types can be compared for crystallinity and amorphization based on the peaks obtained. The spray-dried LPNs are crystalline, as intense peaks are observed (Fig. 9). Some of the crystallinity of spray-dried mannitol is lost, which may indicate amorphization due to the LPNs.

## 4 Notes

1. Calculations of the amounts and volumes used in formulating TNF-α siRNA-loaded LPNs. An example of the calculations for a formulation with an L5 content of 15% (w/w) and an L5:TNF-α siRNA weight ratio of 15:1 is provided below:

   (a) Final batch weight (mg) = weight of L5 (mg) + weight of PLGA (mg) = 15 mg.

   (b) L5 content (15% w/w of total batch size) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn><mn>5</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>&#xd7;</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>5</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>.</mi><mn>2</mn><mn>5</mn><mtext>&#xa0;</mtext><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">g</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>.

   (c) Weight of PLGA (mg) = final batch weight (mg) − weight of L5 (mg) = 15 − 2.25 = 12.75 mg.

   (d) Concentration of stock solution of TNF-α siRNA = 18 mg/mL.

   (e) Amount of TNF-α siRNA (mg) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>1</mn><mn>5</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>&#xd7;</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>.</mi><mn>2</mn><mn>5</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mi>.</mi><mn>1</mn><mn>5</mn><mtext>&#xa0;</mtext><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">g</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>

2. I-optimal designs (also referred to as IV or Integrated Variance) provide lower average prediction variance across the region of experimentation. I-optimality is desirable for response surface methods (RSM) where prediction is important. 

3. When a model is selected in Design-Expert® software, make sure to go through all the evaluation parameters, especially lack of fit and aliasing. Correct the model by excluding specific terms from the equation. 

4. All responses may not be significant and should be carefully analyzed when evaluating the statistical parameters. 

5. Care should be taken while constructing these plots and interpreting data. The OOS may appear to be dynamic when responses are added/removed, criteria are modified, data is over-fitted, and/or the model is aliased. This can result in questionable data quality. 

6. The goal is set to “minimize” for the PDI to aim for a monodisperse formulation. 

7. The desirability displays values between 0 and 1, the latter being a highly desirable condition. However, it may be misinterpreted because the desirability function is entirely dependent on how close the upper and lower limits are set in the QTPP. The goal of optimization is how well the set conditions meet the goals rather than achieving a high desirability. 

8. Make sure that the entire content remains at the bottom of the vial with sufficient headspace for effective evaporation. 

9. It is essential to mix by pipetting because vortexing usually results in liquid spill or loss in the caps, which affects the true yield of the process. 

10. The inner layer of the collection vial is coated with a hydrophobic material and using hard tools may scratch the surface, resulting in loss of the product. The true yield is calculated as the sum of powder lost during the spray drying and the transfer from the collection vial to the storage vial. 

11. Consider that the tiny hook of the thermogravimetric instrument needs to grab the pan. If the bow is bent, restructure it carefully with a pair of tweezers to bend it in a vertical direction so that the bow is directed outside. 

12. Do not get the sample on the bow or overload the pan. The weighing will be done automatically. 

13. Only put a tiny amount of powder on the carbon tape and spread it as a single layer. 

14. The instrument will be properly turned on if the vacuum in the glass chamber is reached, which is evidenced by a tight seal between the O ring and glass tube. 

15. The lid can be opened very easily when the chamber has repressurized. Do not force the lid to open. 

16. The height should be adjusted in such a way that the specimen holder is placed just beneath the cylindrical metal bar on top.
